Neighbouring countries include Indonesia, East Timor and Papua New Guinea to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east.<\/p>\n<p>For at least 40,000 years before the first British settlement in the late 18th century, Australia was inhabited by indigenous Australians, who spoke languages grouped into roughly 250 language groups. After the European discovery of the continent by Dutch explorers in 1606, Australia's eastern half was claimed by Great Britain in 1770 and initially settled through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26 January 1788. The population grew steadily in subsequent decades; the continent was explored and an additional five self-governing Crown Colonies were established.<\/p>\n<p>On 1 January 1901, the six colonies federated, forming the Commonwealth of Australia. Since Federation, Australia has maintained a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal parliamentary democracy and constitutional monarchy comprising six states and several territories. The population of 23.6 million is highly urbanised and heavily concentrated in the eastern states and on the coast.<\/p>\n<p>Australia is a developed country and one of the wealthiest in the world, with the world's 12th-largest economy. In 2012 Australia had the world's fifth-highest per capita income, Australia's military expenditure is the world's 13th-largest. With the second-highest human development index globally, Australia ranks highly in many international comparisons of national performance, such as quality of life, health, education, economic freedom, and the protection of civil liberties and political rights. Australia is a member of the United Nations, G20, Commonwealth of Nations, ANZUS, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), World Trade Organization, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, and the Pacific Islands Forum.<\/p>","woeid":23424748,"created_on":"2011-05-16T23:32:05","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Australia","trend_rank_last":38,"category":"Country","name":"Australia","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=1206","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=1206","trend_rank_current":38,"recent_count":2,"daily_count":5,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Tc","kind":"location","image_height":352,"slug":"australia","links":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/1206\/","geohash":"qgwf78ckqxyp","latest_item_date":"2015-03-24T00:56:48.798893","twitter_username":null,"active":true,"placetype":"Country","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/australia\/","latitude":-24.9121,"image_width":328,"item_count":2259,"facebookchat":"","longitude":133.398,"muted_by_default":false,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Australia\">Wikipedia<\/a>","livevideo":"","image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/e\/e0\/Map_of_Australia.png","id":1206,"local_url":"\/topic\/australia\/"},{"description":"<p><b>Sydney<\/b> \/ˈsɪdni\/ is the state capital of New South Wales and the most populous city in Australia and Oceania.

Since 2013, he has served as the 28th and current Prime Minister of Australia, and has been the Leader of the Liberal Party since 2009. Abbott is the Member of Parliament representing the Sydney-based Division of Warringah, having first been elected at a 1994 by-election.<\/p>\n<p>Abbott was born in London, England, to an Australian mother and English father, and emigrated to Sydney with his parents in 1960. Prior to entering Parliament, he studied for a Bachelor of Economics and a Bachelor of Laws at the University of Sydney, and later for a Master of Arts in Philosophy, Politics and Economics as a Rhodes Scholar at The Queen's College, Oxford.<\/p>\n<p>After graduating, Abbott trained as a Roman Catholic seminarian, later working as a journalist, manager and political advisor. In 1992, he was appointed director of Australians for Constitutional Monarchy, a position he held until 1994, when he was successfully elected to parliament at the Warringah by-election. Abbott was first appointed to Cabinet following the 1998 election, as part of the Second Howard Ministry, becoming Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business. In 2003, he became Minister for Health and Ageing, retaining this position until the defeat of the Howard Government at the 2007 election. Initially serving in the Shadow Cabinets of Brendan Nelson and then Malcolm Turnbull, he resigned from the frontbench in November 2009 in protest against Turnbull's support for the Rudd Government's proposed Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). Forcing a leadership ballot on the subject, Abbott defeated Turnbull by 42 votes to 41 to become the party's leader and Leader of the Opposition.<\/p>\n<p>Abbott led the Coalition at the 2010 election, which resulted in a hung parliament. Following negotiations, Labor formed a Government with the support of one Green MP and three independent MPs, and Abbott was re-elected as Liberal Leader unopposed.

Furthermore, politics is the study or practice of the distribution of power and resources within a given community (a hierarchically organized population) as well as the interrelationship(s) between communities. A variety of methods are employed in politics, which include promoting one's own political views among people, negotiation with other political subjects, making laws, and exercising force, including warfare against adversaries. Politics is exercised on a wide range of social levels, from clans and tribes of traditional societies, through modern local governments, companies and institutions up to sovereign states, to the international level.<\/p>\n<p>A political system is a framework which defines acceptable political methods within a given society.

The term crime does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law (i.e. something is a crime if applicable law says that it is). One proposed definition is that a <b>crime<\/b>, also called an <b>offence<\/b> or a <b>criminal offence<\/b>, is an act harmful not only to some individual, but also to the community or the state (a public wrong). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\r\n<p>The idea that acts like murder, rape and theft are prohibited exists all around the world. What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country. While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.<\/p>\r\n<p>The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime. Therefore, in modern societies, a criminal procedure must be adhered to during the investigation and trial. Only if found guilty, the offender may be sentenced to punishment such as community sentence, imprisonment, life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions, even death.<\/p>\r\n<p>To be classified as a crime, the act of doing something bad (actus reus) must be usually accompanied by the intention to do something bad (mens rea), with certain exceptions (strict liability).<\/p>\r\n<p>While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime. Breaches of private law (torts and breaches of contract) are not automatically punished by the state, but can be enforced through civil procedure.<\/p>","woeid":null,"created_on":"2012-11-28T17:18:53","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Crime","trend_rank_last":1,"category":"Topic","name":"crime & courts","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=1","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=1","trend_rank_current":1,"recent_count":11,"daily_count":76,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/B","kind":"vertical","image_height":900,"slug":"crime-courts","links":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/1\/","geohash":"","latest_item_date":"2015-03-24T01:14:53.150744","twitter_username":null,"active":true,"placetype":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/crime-courts\/","latitude":null,"image_width":1089,"item_count":54161,"facebookchat":"","longitude":null,"muted_by_default":false,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Crime\">Wikipedia<\/a>","livevideo":"","image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/4\/4b\/Pierre-Paul_Prud%27hon_-_Justice_and_Divine_Vengeance_Pursuing_Crime.JPG","id":1,"local_url":"\/topic\/crime-courts\/"}],"data_type":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/CHdL","local_url":"\/item\/2015\/01\/28\/breaking-the-sydney-inquest-into-the-lindt-cafe","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/505373\/","slug":"breaking-the-sydney-inquest-into-the-lindt-cafe","submitter":"partner","url_domain":"twitter.com","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/SkyNewsAust\/status\/560587904955592704","tweet":{"location":"Sydney, Australia","tweet_id":"560587904955592704","user_id":"16834659","content":"#BREAKING: The Sydney inquest into the Lindt Cafe siege has revealed that gunman Man Monis shot Tori Johnson in the back of the head.","name":"Sky News Australia","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/SkyNewsAust\/status\/560587904955592704","avatar":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/378800000441802573\/7d7dfe8dd3ef5cb743d617dc62f0aa92_normal.jpeg","resource_uri":"","screen_name":"SkyNewsAust","id":297723,"date":"2015-01-28T23:59:06"},"date_ap":"Jan 28, 2015, 11:59 PM GMT","push_content":"Inquest into Sydney siege finds that gunman shot 1 victim; 2nd victim was hit multiple times by police - @SkyNewsAust","status":"published","shortened_url":"http:\/\/bit.ly\/15JGoXO","note":null,"source":null,"media":null,"updated_date":"2015-01-29T00:04:13.280447","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2015\/01\/28\/breaking-the-sydney-inquest-into-the-lindt-cafe","author":{"email":"Jillian.Stampher@nbcuni.com","username":"jillian.stamper","full_name":"Jillian Stampher","first_name":"Jillian","is_staff":true,"last_name":"Stampher","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/14\/","id":14},"id":505373,"data":null,"date":"2015-01-28T23:59:59.361190"},{"type":"text","whoas":30,"content":"Australian Treasurer declares Sydney siege a 'terrorist incident' for purposes of the Terrorism Insurance Act - @SkyNewsAust","pushed":false,"importance":3,"topics":[{"description":"","woeid":null,"created_on":"2014-12-14T23:37:51.037468","wikipedia_url":"","trend_rank_last":0,"category":"CrimeCourtsEvent","name":"Sydney hostage situation, December 2014","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=99651","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=99651","trend_rank_current":0,"recent_count":0,"daily_count":0,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Z5R","kind":"arc","image_height":null,"slug":"hostage-situation-in-martin-place-sydney-cafe-december-2014","links":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/99651\/","geohash":"","latest_item_date":"2015-03-20T07:06:27.348760","twitter_username":null,"active":true,"placetype":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/hostage-situation-in-martin-place-sydney-cafe-december-2014\/","latitude":null,"image_width":null,"item_count":177,"facebookchat":"","longitude":null,"muted_by_default":false,"image_credit":"","livevideo":"","image_url":"","id":99651,"local_url":"\/topic\/hostage-situation-in-martin-place-sydney-cafe-december-2014\/"},{"description":"<p><b>Australia<\/b> \/əˈstreɪljə, ɒ-, -iə\/, officially the <b>Commonwealth of Australia<\/b>, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania, and numerous smaller islands.

Common definitions of terrorism refer only to those violent acts that are intended to create fear (terror); are perpetrated for a religious, political, or ideological goal; and deliberately target or disregard the safety of non-combatants (e.g., neutral military personnel or civilians). Some definitions now include acts of unlawful violence and war. The use of similar tactics by criminal organizations for protection rackets or to enforce a code of silence is usually not labeled terrorism, though these same actions may be labeled terrorism when done by a politically motivated group. Usage of the term has also been criticized for its frequent undue equating with <i>Islamism<\/i> or <i>jihadism<\/i>, while ignoring non-Islamic organizations or individuals.<\/p>\r\n<p>The word \"terrorism\" is politically loaded and emotionally charged, and this greatly compounds the difficulty of providing a precise definition. Studies have found over 100 definitions of \"terrorism\". In some cases, the same group may be described as \"freedom fighters\" by its supporters and considered to be terrorists by its opponents. The concept of terrorism may be controversial as it is often used by state authorities (and individuals with access to state support) to delegitimize political or other opponents, and potentially legitimize the state's own use of armed force against opponents (such use of force may be described as \"terror\" by opponents of the state). At the same time, the reverse may also take place when states perpetrate or are accused of perpetrating state terrorism. The usage of the term has a controversial history, with individuals such as ANC leader Nelson Mandela at one point also branded a terrorist.<\/p>\r\n<p>Terrorism has been practiced by a broad array of political organizations to further their objectives. It has been practiced by both right-wing and left-wing political parties, nationalistic groups, religious groups, revolutionaries, and ruling governments. An abiding characteristic is the indiscriminate use of violence against non-combatants for the purpose of gaining publicity for a group, cause, or individual.

Common definitions of terrorism refer only to those violent acts that are intended to create fear (terror); are perpetrated for a religious, political, or ideological goal; and deliberately target or disregard the safety of non-combatants (e.g., neutral military personnel or civilians). Some definitions now include acts of unlawful violence and war. The use of similar tactics by criminal organizations for protection rackets or to enforce a code of silence is usually not labeled terrorism, though these same actions may be labeled terrorism when done by a politically motivated group. Usage of the term has also been criticized for its frequent undue equating with <i>Islamism<\/i> or <i>jihadism<\/i>, while ignoring non-Islamic organizations or individuals.<\/p>\r\n<p>The word \"terrorism\" is politically loaded and emotionally charged, and this greatly compounds the difficulty of providing a precise definition. Studies have found over 100 definitions of \"terrorism\". In some cases, the same group may be described as \"freedom fighters\" by its supporters and considered to be terrorists by its opponents. The concept of terrorism may be controversial as it is often used by state authorities (and individuals with access to state support) to delegitimize political or other opponents, and potentially legitimize the state's own use of armed force against opponents (such use of force may be described as \"terror\" by opponents of the state). At the same time, the reverse may also take place when states perpetrate or are accused of perpetrating state terrorism. The usage of the term has a controversial history, with individuals such as ANC leader Nelson Mandela at one point also branded a terrorist.<\/p>\r\n<p>Terrorism has been practiced by a broad array of political organizations to further their objectives. It has been practiced by both right-wing and left-wing political parties, nationalistic groups, religious groups, revolutionaries, and ruling governments. An abiding characteristic is the indiscriminate use of violence against non-combatants for the purpose of gaining publicity for a group, cause, or individual.

The term crime does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law (i.e. something is a crime if applicable law says that it is). One proposed definition is that a <b>crime<\/b>, also called an <b>offence<\/b> or a <b>criminal offence<\/b>, is an act harmful not only to some individual, but also to the community or the state (a public wrong). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\r\n<p>The idea that acts like murder, rape and theft are prohibited exists all around the world.

While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.<\/p>\r\n<p>The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime. Therefore, in modern societies, a criminal procedure must be adhered to during the investigation and trial. Only if found guilty, the offender may be sentenced to punishment such as community sentence, imprisonment, life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions, even death.<\/p>\r\n<p>To be classified as a crime, the act of doing something bad (actus reus) must be usually accompanied by the intention to do something bad (mens rea), with certain exceptions (strict liability).<\/p>\r\n<p>While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime.

It is generally characterised by extreme violence, social disruption and economic destruction.

The set of techniques used by a group to carry out war is known as <b>warfare<\/b>. An absence of war is usually called peace.<\/p>\n<p>While some scholars see warfare as an inescapable and integral aspect of human nature, others argue that it is only inevitable under certain socio-cultural or ecological circumstances. For some the practice of war is not linked to any single type of political organization or society. Rather, as discussed by John Keegan in his <i>A History of Warfare<\/i>, war is a universal phenomenon whose form and scope is defined by the society that wages it. Another argument suggests that since there are human societies in which warfare does not exist, humans may not be naturally disposed for warfare, which emerges under particular circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>The deadliest war in history, in terms of the cumulative number of deaths since its start, is the Second World War, with 60–85 million deaths, followed by the Mongol conquests.

In its self-proclaimed status as a caliphate, it claims religious authority over all Muslims across the world and aspires to bring much of the Muslim-inhabited regions of the world under its political control, beginning with Iraq, Syria and other territory in the Levant region, which includes Jordan, Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, Cyprus and part of southern Turkey. It has been designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Indonesia and Saudi Arabia, and has been described by the United Nations and Western and Middle Eastern media as a terrorist group.

At its height it enjoyed a significant presence in the Iraqi governorates of Al Anbar, Nineveh, Kirkuk, most of Salah ad Din, parts of Babil, Diyala and Baghdad, and claimed Baqubah as a capital city.

Common definitions of terrorism refer only to those violent acts that are intended to create fear (terror); are perpetrated for a religious, political, or ideological goal; and deliberately target or disregard the safety of non-combatants (e.g., neutral military personnel or civilians). Some definitions now include acts of unlawful violence and war. The use of similar tactics by criminal organizations for protection rackets or to enforce a code of silence is usually not labeled terrorism, though these same actions may be labeled terrorism when done by a politically motivated group. Usage of the term has also been criticized for its frequent undue equating with <i>Islamism<\/i> or <i>jihadism<\/i>, while ignoring non-Islamic organizations or individuals.<\/p>\r\n<p>The word \"terrorism\" is politically loaded and emotionally charged, and this greatly compounds the difficulty of providing a precise definition. Studies have found over 100 definitions of \"terrorism\". In some cases, the same group may be described as \"freedom fighters\" by its supporters and considered to be terrorists by its opponents. The concept of terrorism may be controversial as it is often used by state authorities (and individuals with access to state support) to delegitimize political or other opponents, and potentially legitimize the state's own use of armed force against opponents (such use of force may be described as \"terror\" by opponents of the state). At the same time, the reverse may also take place when states perpetrate or are accused of perpetrating state terrorism. The usage of the term has a controversial history, with individuals such as ANC leader Nelson Mandela at one point also branded a terrorist.<\/p>\r\n<p>Terrorism has been practiced by a broad array of political organizations to further their objectives. It has been practiced by both right-wing and left-wing political parties, nationalistic groups, religious groups, revolutionaries, and ruling governments. An abiding characteristic is the indiscriminate use of violence against non-combatants for the purpose of gaining publicity for a group, cause, or individual.

It is generally characterised by extreme violence, social disruption and economic destruction. War should be understood as an actual, intentional and widespread armed conflict between political communities, and therefore is defined as a form of (collective) political violence or intervention. The set of techniques used by a group to carry out war is known as <b>warfare<\/b>. An absence of war is usually called peace.<\/p>\n<p>While some scholars see warfare as an inescapable and integral aspect of human nature, others argue that it is only inevitable under certain socio-cultural or ecological circumstances. For some the practice of war is not linked to any single type of political organization or society. Rather, as discussed by John Keegan in his <i>A History of Warfare<\/i>, war is a universal phenomenon whose form and scope is defined by the society that wages it.

Common definitions of terrorism refer only to those violent acts that are intended to create fear (terror); are perpetrated for a religious, political, or ideological goal; and deliberately target or disregard the safety of non-combatants (e.g., neutral military personnel or civilians). Some definitions now include acts of unlawful violence and war. The use of similar tactics by criminal organizations for protection rackets or to enforce a code of silence is usually not labeled terrorism, though these same actions may be labeled terrorism when done by a politically motivated group. Usage of the term has also been criticized for its frequent undue equating with <i>Islamism<\/i> or <i>jihadism<\/i>, while ignoring non-Islamic organizations or individuals.<\/p>\r\n<p>The word \"terrorism\" is politically loaded and emotionally charged, and this greatly compounds the difficulty of providing a precise definition. Studies have found over 100 definitions of \"terrorism\". In some cases, the same group may be described as \"freedom fighters\" by its supporters and considered to be terrorists by its opponents. The concept of terrorism may be controversial as it is often used by state authorities (and individuals with access to state support) to delegitimize political or other opponents, and potentially legitimize the state's own use of armed force against opponents (such use of force may be described as \"terror\" by opponents of the state). At the same time, the reverse may also take place when states perpetrate or are accused of perpetrating state terrorism. The usage of the term has a controversial history, with individuals such as ANC leader Nelson Mandela at one point also branded a terrorist.<\/p>\r\n<p>Terrorism has been practiced by a broad array of political organizations to further their objectives. It has been practiced by both right-wing and left-wing political parties, nationalistic groups, religious groups, revolutionaries, and ruling governments. An abiding characteristic is the indiscriminate use of violence against non-combatants for the purpose of gaining publicity for a group, cause, or individual.

The term crime does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law (i.e. something is a crime if applicable law says that it is). One proposed definition is that a <b>crime<\/b>, also called an <b>offence<\/b> or a <b>criminal offence<\/b>, is an act harmful not only to some individual, but also to the community or the state (a public wrong). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\r\n<p>The idea that acts like murder, rape and theft are prohibited exists all around the world. What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country. While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.<\/p>\r\n<p>The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime. Therefore, in modern societies, a criminal procedure must be adhered to during the investigation and trial. Only if found guilty, the offender may be sentenced to punishment such as community sentence, imprisonment, life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions, even death.<\/p>\r\n<p>To be classified as a crime, the act of doing something bad (actus reus) must be usually accompanied by the intention to do something bad (mens rea), with certain exceptions (strict liability).<\/p>\r\n<p>While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime.

The set of techniques used by a group to carry out war is known as <b>warfare<\/b>. An absence of war is usually called peace.<\/p>\n<p>While some scholars see warfare as an inescapable and integral aspect of human nature, others argue that it is only inevitable under certain socio-cultural or ecological circumstances.

Rather, as discussed by John Keegan in his <i>A History of Warfare<\/i>, war is a universal phenomenon whose form and scope is defined by the society that wages it.

An abiding characteristic is the indiscriminate use of violence against non-combatants for the purpose of gaining publicity for a group, cause, or individual. The symbolism of terrorism can exploit human fear to help achieve these goals.<\/p>","woeid":null,"created_on":"2011-05-16T17:28:30","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Terrorism","trend_rank_last":357,"category":"Topic","name":"terrorism","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=710","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=710","trend_rank_current":352,"recent_count":0,"daily_count":1,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Lc","kind":"tag","image_height":925,"slug":"terrorism","links":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/710\/","geohash":"","latest_item_date":"2015-03-23T08:46:24.874494","twitter_username":null,"active":true,"placetype":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/terrorism\/","latitude":null,"image_width":1063,"item_count":2535,"facebookchat":"","longitude":null,"muted_by_default":false,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Terrorism\">Wikipedia<\/a>","livevideo":"","image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/8\/8a\/UA_Flight_175_hits_WTC_south_tower_9-11_edit.jpeg","id":710,"local_url":"\/topic\/terrorism\/"},{"description":"<p>In ordinary language, the term <b>crime<\/b> denotes an unlawful act punishable by a state.

It is generally characterised by extreme violence, social disruption and economic destruction. War should be understood as an actual, intentional and widespread armed conflict between political communities, and therefore is defined as a form of (collective) political violence or intervention. The set of techniques used by a group to carry out war is known as <b>warfare<\/b>. An absence of war is usually called peace.<\/p>\n<p>While some scholars see warfare as an inescapable and integral aspect of human nature, others argue that it is only inevitable under certain socio-cultural or ecological circumstances. For some the practice of war is not linked to any single type of political organization or society. Rather, as discussed by John Keegan in his <i>A History of Warfare<\/i>, war is a universal phenomenon whose form and scope is defined by the society that wages it. Another argument suggests that since there are human societies in which warfare does not exist, humans may not be naturally disposed for warfare, which emerges under particular circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>The deadliest war in history, in terms of the cumulative number of deaths since its start, is the Second World War, with 60–85 million deaths, followed by the Mongol conquests. Proportionally speaking, the most destructive war in modern history is the War of the Triple Alliance, which took the lives of over 60% of Paraguay's population, according to Steven Pinker. In 2003, Richard Smalley identified war as the sixth (of ten) biggest problems facing humanity for the next fifty years.<\/p>","woeid":null,"created_on":"2012-11-28T17:18:48","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/War","trend_rank_last":17,"category":"Topic","name":"war & conflict","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=15","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=15","trend_rank_current":17,"recent_count":2,"daily_count":25,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/P","kind":"vertical","image_height":768,"slug":"war-conflict","links":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/15\/","geohash":"","latest_item_date":"2015-03-23T23:42:47.566836","twitter_username":null,"active":true,"placetype":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/war-conflict\/","latitude":null,"image_width":589,"item_count":29522,"facebookchat":"","longitude":null,"muted_by_default":false,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/War\">Wikipedia<\/a>","livevideo":"","image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/a\/a7\/Cyprian_War.jpg","id":15,"local_url":"\/topic\/war-conflict\/"}],"data_type":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/CCoG","local_url":"\/item\/2014\/12\/22\/court-found-the-unacceptable-risk-amirah-droudis","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/486830\/","slug":"court-found-the-unacceptable-risk-amirah-droudis","submitter":"editor","url_domain":"heraldsun.com.au","url":"http:\/\/www.heraldsun.com.au\/news\/sydney-siege-man-haron-moniss-wife-amirah-droudis-has-bail-revoked-is-taken-into-custody\/story-fnii5s3y-1227163993815","tweet":null,"date_ap":"Dec 22, 2014, 07:10 AM GMT","push_content":"Court found the 'unacceptable risk' Amirah Droudis posed couldn't be mitigated by tight bail conditions - @theheraldsun","status":"published","shortened_url":"http:\/\/bit.ly\/1sP947c","note":null,"source":null,"media":null,"updated_date":"2014-12-22T07:11:00.725096","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2014\/12\/22\/court-found-the-unacceptable-risk-amirah-droudis","author":{"email":"david.wyllie@breakingnews.com","username":"david.wyllie","full_name":"David Wyllie","first_name":"David","is_staff":true,"last_name":"Wyllie","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/12\/","id":12},"id":486830,"data":null,"date":"2014-12-22T07:10:56.964214"},{"type":"text","whoas":31,"content":"Wife of the Sydney siege gunman Amirah Droudis has bail revoked - @SkyNewsAust","pushed":false,"importance":3,"topics":[{"description":"","woeid":null,"created_on":"2014-12-14T23:37:51.037468","wikipedia_url":"","trend_rank_last":0,"category":"CrimeCourtsEvent","name":"Sydney hostage situation, December 2014","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=99651","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=99651","trend_rank_current":0,"recent_count":0,"daily_count":0,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Z5R","kind":"arc","image_height":null,"slug":"hostage-situation-in-martin-place-sydney-cafe-december-2014","links":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/99651\/","geohash":"","latest_item_date":"2015-03-20T07:06:27.348760","twitter_username":null,"active":true,"placetype":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/hostage-situation-in-martin-place-sydney-cafe-december-2014\/","latitude":null,"image_width":null,"item_count":177,"facebookchat":"","longitude":null,"muted_by_default":false,"image_credit":"","livevideo":"","image_url":"","id":99651,"local_url":"\/topic\/hostage-situation-in-martin-place-sydney-cafe-december-2014\/"},{"description":"<p><b>Sydney<\/b> \/ˈsɪdni\/ is the state capital of New South Wales and the most populous city in Australia and Oceania.

The 48 contiguous states and Washington, D.C., are in central North America between Canada and Mexico. The state of Alaska is the northwestern part of North America and the state of Hawaii is an archipelago in the mid-Pacific. The country also has five populated and nine unpopulated territories in the Pacific and the Caribbean. At 3.71 million square miles (9.62 million km<sup>2<\/sup>) and with around 318 million people, the United States is the world's 3rd or 4th-largest country by total area and third-largest by population. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many countries. The geography and climate of the United States is also extremely diverse, and it is home to a wide variety of wildlife.<\/p>\n<p>Paleo-Indians migrated from Eurasia to what is now the U.S. mainland around 15,000 years ago, with European colonization beginning in the 16th century. The United States emerged from 13 British colonies located along the Atlantic seaboard. Disputes between Great Britain and these colonies led to the American Revolution. On July 4, 1776, as the colonies were fighting Great Britain in the American Revolutionary War, delegates from the 13 colonies unanimously issued the Declaration of Independence. The war ended in 1783 with the recognition of independence of the United States from the Kingdom of Great Britain, and was the first successful war of independence against a European colonial empire. The current Constitution was adopted on September 17, 1787. The first ten amendments, collectively named the Bill of Rights, were ratified in 1791 and guarantee many fundamental civil rights and freedoms.<\/p>\n<p>Driven by the doctrine of manifest destiny, the United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century. This involved displacing native tribes, acquiring new territories, and gradually admitting new states. The American Civil War ended legal slavery in the country. By the end of the 19th century, the United States extended into the Pacific Ocean, and its economy was the world's largest. The Spanish–American War and World War I confirmed the country's status as a global military power. The United States emerged from World War II as a global superpower, the first country with nuclear weapons, and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. The end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union left the United States as the sole superpower.<\/p>\n<p>The United States is a developed country and has the world's largest national economy, with an estimated GDP in 2013 of $16.8 trillion—23% of global nominal GDP and 19% at purchasing-power parity. The economy is fueled by an abundance of natural resources and high worker productivity, with per capita GDP being the world's sixth-highest in 2010. While the U.S. economy is considered post-industrial, it continues to be one of the world's largest manufacturers. The U.S. has the highest mean and 4th highest median household income in the OECD as well as the highest gross average wage, though it has the 4th most unequal income distribution, with roughly 15% of the population living in poverty as defined by the U.S. Census. The country accounts for 37% of global military spending, being the world's foremost economic and military power, a prominent political and cultural force, and a leader in scientific research and technological innovation.<\/p>","woeid":23424977,"created_on":"2011-05-16T20:05:25","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States","trend_rank_last":8,"category":"Country","name":"United States","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=10","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=10","trend_rank_current":8,"recent_count":0,"daily_count":7,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/K","kind":"location","image_height":650,"slug":"united-states","links":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/10\/","geohash":"9yeg6ypy9wsp","latest_item_date":"2015-03-23T19:09:43.114314","twitter_username":null,"active":true,"placetype":"Country","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/united-states\/","latitude":37.1679,"image_width":1235,"item_count":16301,"facebookchat":"","longitude":-95.845,"muted_by_default":false,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States\">Wikipedia<\/a>","livevideo":"","image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/a\/a4\/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg","id":10,"local_url":"\/topic\/united-states\/"},{"description":"<p>The <b>United States Department of State<\/b> (<b>DoS<\/b>), often referred to as the <b>State Department<\/b>, is the United States federal executive department responsible for international relations of the United States, equivalent to the foreign ministry of other countries.

The 48 contiguous states and Washington, D.C., are in central North America between Canada and Mexico. The state of Alaska is the northwestern part of North America and the state of Hawaii is an archipelago in the mid-Pacific. The country also has five populated and nine unpopulated territories in the Pacific and the Caribbean. At 3.71 million square miles (9.62 million km<sup>2<\/sup>) and with around 318 million people, the United States is the world's 3rd or 4th-largest country by total area and third-largest by population. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many countries. The geography and climate of the United States is also extremely diverse, and it is home to a wide variety of wildlife.<\/p>\n<p>Paleo-Indians migrated from Eurasia to what is now the U.S. mainland around 15,000 years ago, with European colonization beginning in the 16th century. The United States emerged from 13 British colonies located along the Atlantic seaboard. Disputes between Great Britain and these colonies led to the American Revolution. On July 4, 1776, as the colonies were fighting Great Britain in the American Revolutionary War, delegates from the 13 colonies unanimously issued the Declaration of Independence. The war ended in 1783 with the recognition of independence of the United States from the Kingdom of Great Britain, and was the first successful war of independence against a European colonial empire. The current Constitution was adopted on September 17, 1787. The first ten amendments, collectively named the Bill of Rights, were ratified in 1791 and guarantee many fundamental civil rights and freedoms.<\/p>\n<p>Driven by the doctrine of manifest destiny, the United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century. This involved displacing native tribes, acquiring new territories, and gradually admitting new states. The American Civil War ended legal slavery in the country. By the end of the 19th century, the United States extended into the Pacific Ocean, and its economy was the world's largest. The Spanish–American War and World War I confirmed the country's status as a global military power. The United States emerged from World War II as a global superpower, the first country with nuclear weapons, and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. The end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union left the United States as the sole superpower.<\/p>\n<p>The United States is a developed country and has the world's largest national economy, with an estimated GDP in 2013 of $16.8 trillion—23% of global nominal GDP and 19% at purchasing-power parity. The economy is fueled by an abundance of natural resources and high worker productivity, with per capita GDP being the world's sixth-highest in 2010. While the U.S. economy is considered post-industrial, it continues to be one of the world's largest manufacturers. The U.S. has the highest mean and 4th highest median household income in the OECD as well as the highest gross average wage, though it has the 4th most unequal income distribution, with roughly 15% of the population living in poverty as defined by the U.S. Census.

It is generally characterised by extreme violence, social disruption and economic destruction. War should be understood as an actual, intentional and widespread armed conflict between political communities, and therefore is defined as a form of (collective) political violence or intervention. The set of techniques used by a group to carry out war is known as <b>warfare<\/b>. An absence of war is usually called peace.<\/p>\n<p>While some scholars see warfare as an inescapable and integral aspect of human nature, others argue that it is only inevitable under certain socio-cultural or ecological circumstances. For some the practice of war is not linked to any single type of political organization or society. Rather, as discussed by John Keegan in his <i>A History of Warfare<\/i>, war is a universal phenomenon whose form and scope is defined by the society that wages it. Another argument suggests that since there are human societies in which warfare does not exist, humans may not be naturally disposed for warfare, which emerges under particular circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>The deadliest war in history, in terms of the cumulative number of deaths since its start, is the Second World War, with 60–85 million deaths, followed by the Mongol conquests. Proportionally speaking, the most destructive war in modern history is the War of the Triple Alliance, which took the lives of over 60% of Paraguay's population, according to Steven Pinker. In 2003, Richard Smalley identified war as the sixth (of ten) biggest problems facing humanity for the next fifty years.<\/p>","woeid":null,"created_on":"2012-11-28T17:18:48","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/War","trend_rank_last":17,"category":"Topic","name":"war & conflict","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=15","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=15","trend_rank_current":17,"recent_count":2,"daily_count":25,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/P","kind":"vertical","image_height":768,"slug":"war-conflict","links":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/15\/","geohash":"","latest_item_date":"2015-03-23T23:42:47.566836","twitter_username":null,"active":true,"placetype":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/war-conflict\/","latitude":null,"image_width":589,"item_count":29522,"facebookchat":"","longitude":null,"muted_by_default":false,"image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/War\">Wikipedia<\/a>","livevideo":"","image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/a\/a7\/Cyprian_War.jpg","id":15,"local_url":"\/topic\/war-conflict\/"}],"data_type":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/CCct","local_url":"\/item\/2014\/12\/19\/us-state-department-issues-a-worldwide-travel-aler","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/486125\/","slug":"us-state-department-issues-a-worldwide-travel-aler","submitter":"editor","url_domain":"twitter.com","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/AliABCNews\/status\/546060141372534784","tweet":{"location":"ÜT: 40.57206,-74.327759","tweet_id":"546060141372534784","user_id":"49620730","content":"The State Department issued a Worldwide Travel Alert, only the second of its kind, citing the Sydney, Australia lone wolf attack","name":"Ali Weinberg","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/AliABCNews\/status\/546060141372534784","avatar":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/431578865694040064\/3TCkqd7p_normal.jpeg","resource_uri":"","screen_name":"AliABCNews","id":280478,"date":"2014-12-19T21:50:57"},"date_ap":"Dec 19, 2014, 09:57 PM GMT","push_content":"US State Department issues a worldwide travel alert, only the 2nd of its kind, citing the Sydney, Australia, lone wolf attack - @AliABCNews","status":"published","shortened_url":"http:\/\/bit.ly\/1x5R53s","note":null,"source":null,"media":null,"updated_date":"2014-12-19T21:57:32.852891","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2014\/12\/19\/us-state-department-issues-a-worldwide-travel-aler","author":{"email":"stephanie.clary@breakingnews.com","username":"stephanie.clary","full_name":"Stephanie Clary","first_name":"Stephanie","is_staff":true,"last_name":"Clary","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/8\/","id":8},"id":486125,"data":null,"date":"2014-12-19T21:57:20.219502"},{"type":"text","whoas":31,"content":"Authorities remove suspicious bag from Martin Place, Sydney, near memorial for victims of hostage situation - @SkyNewsAust","pushed":true,"importance":2,"topics":[{"description":"","woeid":null,"created_on":"2014-12-14T23:37:51.037468","wikipedia_url":"","trend_rank_last":0,"category":"CrimeCourtsEvent","name":"Sydney hostage situation, December 2014","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=99651","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=99651","trend_rank_current":0,"recent_count":0,"daily_count":0,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Z5R","kind":"arc","image_height":null,"slug":"hostage-situation-in-martin-place-sydney-cafe-december-2014","links":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/99651\/","geohash":"","latest_item_date":"2015-03-20T07:06:27.348760","twitter_username":null,"active":true,"placetype":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/hostage-situation-in-martin-place-sydney-cafe-december-2014\/","latitude":null,"image_width":null,"item_count":177,"facebookchat":"","longitude":null,"muted_by_default":false,"image_credit":"","livevideo":"","image_url":"","id":99651,"local_url":"\/topic\/hostage-situation-in-martin-place-sydney-cafe-december-2014\/"},{"description":"<p><b>Martin Place<\/b> is a pedestrian mall in the central business district of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.

The codes would be updated regularly and provided to the police and the media.<\/p>\n<p>In May of 2014, Bristol, Connecticut had 7 bomb threats at 7 different schools within a 10 day span.<\/p>","woeid":null,"created_on":"2012-12-13T00:33:09","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bomb_threat","trend_rank_last":44,"category":"CrimeCourtsEvent","name":"bomb threats","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=1265","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=1265","trend_rank_current":45,"recent_count":0,"daily_count":3,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/UZ","kind":"tag","image_height":null,"slug":"bomb-threats","links":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/1265\/","geohash":"","latest_item_date":"2015-03-23T13:08:06.635796","twitter_username":null,"active":true,"placetype":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/bomb-threats\/","latitude":null,"image_width":null,"item_count":858,"facebookchat":"","longitude":null,"muted_by_default":false,"image_credit":"","livevideo":"","image_url":"","id":1265,"local_url":"\/topic\/bomb-threats\/"}],"data_type":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/CCVh","local_url":"\/item\/2014\/12\/19\/police-in-new-south-wales-investigating-suspicious","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/485679\/","slug":"police-in-new-south-wales-investigating-suspicious","submitter":"editor","url_domain":null,"url":"","tweet":null,"date_ap":"Dec 19, 2014, 05:17 AM GMT","push_content":"Police in New South Wales investigating suspicious bag near memorial site of Sydney siege in Martin Place - @SkyNewsAust","status":"published","shortened_url":null,"note":null,"source":null,"media":null,"updated_date":"2014-12-19T05:17:34.654189","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2014\/12\/19\/police-in-new-south-wales-investigating-suspicious","author":{"email":"Jillian.Stampher@nbcuni.com","username":"jillian.stamper","full_name":"Jillian Stampher","first_name":"Jillian","is_staff":true,"last_name":"Stampher","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/14\/","id":14},"id":485679,"data":null,"date":"2014-12-19T05:17:32.786807"},{"type":"text","whoas":25,"content":"Flowers left at Sydney's Martin Place to be collected, composted and used to cultivate and fertilize a memorial garden - @Sandra_Sully","pushed":false,"importance":1,"topics":[{"description":"","woeid":null,"created_on":"2014-12-14T23:37:51.037468","wikipedia_url":"","trend_rank_last":0,"category":"CrimeCourtsEvent","name":"Sydney hostage situation, December 2014","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=99651","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=99651","trend_rank_current":0,"recent_count":0,"daily_count":0,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Z5R","kind":"arc","image_height":null,"slug":"hostage-situation-in-martin-place-sydney-cafe-december-2014","links":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/99651\/","geohash":"","latest_item_date":"2015-03-20T07:06:27.348760","twitter_username":null,"active":true,"placetype":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/hostage-situation-in-martin-place-sydney-cafe-december-2014\/","latitude":null,"image_width":null,"item_count":177,"facebookchat":"","longitude":null,"muted_by_default":false,"image_credit":"","livevideo":"","image_url":"","id":99651,"local_url":"\/topic\/hostage-situation-in-martin-place-sydney-cafe-december-2014\/"},{"description":"<p><b>Australia<\/b> \/əˈstreɪljə, ɒ-, -iə\/, officially the <b>Commonwealth of Australia<\/b>, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania, and numerous smaller islands.
