Cobra is a messenger for the Resistance Movement. Cobra himself/herself may or may not be part of the Resistance Movement. <br /><br /><br />What is important is the message and not the messenger. Human mind usually associates given message with perceived characteristics of the messenger and this tends to cloud its objectivity. <br /><br />===<br /><br />Update from the Galactic Federation of Light &amp; Love<br /><br /><br />March, 2015 <br /><br />11 Cib, 14 Ceh, 11 Ik<br /><br />Selamat Jarin! We return in Joy! Those earthly allies in charge of seeing that the international transfer of currency is done correctly and without bias are ready to shortly begin a process, which is to lead to the global distribution of your blessings. They are finally testing the new system. This system is tied to the global currency reset. In addition, this process is eventually to produce the conditions whereby the NESARA legislation can at last be enacted in the U.S. and globally. New governance is the most important goal for us. We have watched the old pro-cabal regime's cover-up and global misinformation campaign about us. The new governance is to transform this odd policy into full disclosure. This policy can permit us to be more open about our daylight activities. We wish to show you that we are benevolent. We can then complete projects that require us to perform maneuvers to remove the latent dangers from Fukushima radiation in your oceans, air and water. In addition, we wish to land temporarily and check out a number of Gaia’s special grid nodes. We need to perform tests that put our scientists in a number of places around your globe.<br /><br />   Gaia needs to be aided in her efforts to preserve her many ecological life zones. At some point, the surface of your planet is to require a very massive make over. We have used our efforts to do what is, in essence, your job to preserve this global environment. Ever since your western European business models became the norm, your world’s surface has suffered. Where once there was immense forestland, you now see vast destruction of traditional habitat. We are not advocating a continuance on your world of certain primitive realities. What we wish is for you to use a number of advanced technologies to preserve and expand habitats. We intend to introduce devices that further increase the technology you already possess. What you now lack is the full commitment to do so. New governance can change this important element and allow you as a people to succeed with rapid ecological damage control. These series of actions can quickly renew the vital relationships between your global societies and Mother Earth. More importantly, this can teach you how truly valuable such unselfish acts are!<br /><br />   What is happening to you is a seemingly slow, but in reality, is a swift march to full consciousness. Heaven is determined that you evolve back into galactic humans. Hence, Heaven decreed to our spiritual councils that we send our fleets to monitor you daily. Over each succeeding decade, we have gotten more deeply involved with the process to shift this society of humans from the darkness of the past 13 millennia to the awesomeness of the Light. This process has proceeded among you more slowly than we wanted. Yet, our purpose remains to be the true representatives of Heaven’s mission on this world. At first, those involved with this heavenly transformation were somewhat leery of our constant presence. It has taken over a decade to resolve these worries fully. Our diplomatic corps as well encountered a stone walling from your governments. However, all has changed for the better in the past few years. With our help, those representing the Light have won a number of very vital court decisions. In addition, our technologies have prevented the dark from stealing a great deal of the Light’s precious assets.<br /><br />   These events forged a true alliance between our now earthly allies and brought panic to the cabal. Both sides now permit us to have true exchanges with them. These meetings helped us to develop a real set of strategies with our earthly allies. Similarly, the cabal’s representatives are beginning to see us in a newer light. We are Heaven’s galactic option. Many of the events to be staged to crush their opposition are currently seen as impossible and were recently abandoned. What is left is a charade that goes on daily between governments, the press and the Internet’s slew of rumors. This is to continue until the present system is either victorious or else defeated by the Light. We are here to ensure Heaven’s grand victory. Your time in the dark is indeed coming to a most glorious end! Many events that signal an end to this awful reality are beginning to manifest. It is our task to finish these preliminaries, then land, and with great joy meet you. At that time, our mentors can take you toward the wonders of full consciousness!<br /><br />   Namaste! We are your Ascended Masters! We arrive with great blessings! Our earthly associates are busily testing and preparing to approve a system for carrying out the delivery of your prosperity funds. There are as well a number of groups that are preparing to manifest the U.S. NESARA legislation. The U.S. Supreme Court initially sequestered this legislation at the turn of this millennium. The time arrives to take this extraordinary document public. Various individuals are finishing plans that are to bring these documents out of the surreptitious protection they have long enjoyed. When this happens shortly, it is to mark the return of your true republic, and the need to dearly protect it. As Masters, we deeply bless this and know that this great change is to be a peaceful one. This transformation of rule is to be the start of a greater alteration, which is to signal the end of cabal rule. You are to be introduced to clean and transparent governance!<br /><br />   Constantly remember that all of this is a divine blessing. We thank those of courage and of magnificent abilities who made all of this possible. We thank as well each of you who have long held this vision and permitted your great energies to be added to all that we do. This work has taken a number of millennia to accomplish. Now it is you and your prodigy who are to gladly taste this most delicious fruit. Be ever grateful to Heaven and ready to praise all who have come from afar to aid you in this cause. We are watching each of you grow in consciousness. And gracefully use your new abilities to help these most arduous proceedings to succeed. You are now to watch as many that you did not know, rise and in unison help Gaia and this “global village” you reside in, to alter and produce a new reality. It is this reality, which is to welcome your greater family.<br /><br />   The wondrous spiritual energies are there to alter this reality and ready you for your crystal Light chambers. This special living Light is to give you back what the Atlanteans took from you. You are to expand this large band of Masters and complete the work began long ago in ancient Lemuria. You are to see the rebirth of this solar star nation and to use your powers to greatly increase the meditations and prayers that we perform daily to help the Earth and her sister worlds. Our Sun contains a mighty Spirit, which welcomes you in joy to this new realm. The darkness served a purpose. You are to use its acquired wisdom, much as we have, to transmit the power of the Light everywhere. We are to supervise and guide you on your next journeys. There is much that Heaven desires to give you instruction on. As ones in divine service, we await gladly what Heaven so desires. Hosanna! Hosanna! Hosanna!<br /><br />   Today, we continued our message! This world is changing. As it does, it brings you ever closer to the glorious realm that you have long awaited! Your patience and your frustration are hereby acknowledged. We simply request that you thoroughly enjoy the wonders that are to appear! Know, dear Ones, that the countless Supply and never-ending Prosperity of Heaven are indeed yours! So Be It! Selamat Gajun! Selamat Ja! (Sirian for Be One! and Be in Joy!)<br /><br />last week...<br /><br /><br />v4 Muluc, 7 Ceh, 11 Ik     Selamat Balik! <br /><br />We come bringing you great news! The new banking system, which we have talked about from time to time, is quickly becoming an international reality. Meanwhile, the breakdown of the U.S. governing corporation continues. The world’s nations understand more fully what this coming collapse truly means. A new economic and financial system is emerging, which puts the US on a par with a number of nations in Europe, Asia and the western hemisphere. This new set of realities is finally bringing an end to the highly distorted realities that governed your world during the first six decades of the post-World War II era. A new era is forming, which is to feature the rise of the NESARA governance in the US as well as a whole slew of new governances in Europe, Asia, Africa and the Western Hemisphere. The highlight of this, in our minds, is disclosure. At that time, we can easily address you and permit you, at last, to see our ships in your daylight skies. We fully intend to support the global addresses of your Ascended Masters and the open interactions possible with your Agarthan relatives. You can then learn much about yourselves and your true history and origins.<br /><br />What is finally to happen on your world is going to preserve and protect your reality. Many years ago, we arrived and witnessed a society, which can only be described as an unconscious and uncaring one. Over the last decade, your society has literally grown up. Even the most environmentally incorrect is now busily forging some sort of alliances with those who more deeply protect your many fragile habitats. These sudden shifts in every society on Gaia are a sign of how much your globe is currently shifting. While these changes are making a great dent in how your societies react to ecology, it is still only a beginning. Much needs to be done once we land en masse upon your world. Habitats for a great many animals and plants are still rapidly shrinking. You need to apply technologies that have the ability to alter this sorry circumstance. You as well need to use more informed reasoning about how to return a large part of your world to a more natural reality. You need to use technology to create a proper habitat and not to destroy it.<br /><br />On our worlds, the natural pristine nature of our surface and inner world realms is undisturbed by us. In fact, if someone was to suddenly appear unannounced on any of our worlds, their initial thought is probably to pronounce the world to be mostly uninhabited. This belief is something that mirrors an important corollary of our sacred laws: all life is sacred and needs to be preserved in its natural state of existence. This Solar system was harshly invaded millions of years ago and a horrible price was paid for this. What is required is for us to assist you and the heavenly Elohim in restoring this solar realm to its previous pristine state. Mars and Venus once contained major oceans, teeming with all types of life. These things need to be restored. Not only the vast oceans of these and other solar worlds, but as well the many types of unique phenomena currently lost. This rebirth is only one of the things that we need to do. There as well is the responsibility to mend the ties with a great number of non-corporeal Beings residing deep within the inner world of your many gas giant worlds.<br /><br />As you can see, a great series of new responsibilities are to descend upon you as your consciousness returns. To us, these duties are sacred. When you become both planetary and solar guardians you inherit a place of great beauty whose upkeep becomes your everyday duty. When you become a member of a science and exploration fleet, this set of duties vastly increase. We have been in this solar system for over two decades and are somewhat repulsed by how it was “worked” by the Anunnaki and their planetary minions. Most of all, we were repelled by how these Beings in charge treated each of you millennia after millennia. From time to time our ships had visited you and presented historical accounts of this ill treatment to a number of special fleet reports on the progress in this solar system. Heaven’s call to us was at first shocking. Nevertheless, we listened and are here to serve you fully. We expect you to progress rapidly in the next year toward full consciousness by completely reordering the reality you now reside in. Hosanna! Hosanna! Hosanna!<br /><br />Blessings. We are your Ascended Masters! We come with a sound reiteration of what was said so forthrightly by our family from space. Our earthly associates have created a new international funds transfer system. In addition, a number of changes were made to make all major banks Basel III compliant. These are only the beginnings of what is to be expected. The BRICS group development bank is ready to come online and replace both the SWIFT system and the international status of the Federal Reserve and the IMF. This blessed development implies two things. First, international money transfers are no longer the concern of the banking system set up by the Dumbarton treaty in 1944. Second, the western banking criteria now used by the IMF is to be replaced by one more conducive to international development. These alterations are to make possible the easy transfers of large sums to kick-start the need to develop the infrastructure of your world.<br /><br />Both the undeveloped and the developed world require funds to either build or rebuild a vast network for water conservation and transportation. There is as well a need to give this realm the monies to construct a vast network for the educating of children and adults. For too long, governance has dumbed down or ignored this great responsibility. You are growing in consciousness and require the tools needed to understand fully what is happening across this globe. In addition, a special class filled with truly meaningful ecology lessons has to be taught to all. Previous prejudices against women and religion require an end. The Creator in truth made us one people. We need to blessedly obey this sacred edict and learn how to live together. All religions teach this great truth. We need to obey this globally. Consider how war, misplaced hatreds and simple ill logic have maintained these barriers.<br /><br />As you come together, be ever mindful of certain new responsibities to keep your newfound humanhood, to maintain the integrity of nature’s environments and to be ready to help each other move forward. The new consciousness is to make you more spiritually aware of each other, and especially of the gifts freely given you by Gaia. This world needs to be respected and heartily cared for. This is divine grace in action. You are moving spiritually from a world run by uncaring ones to a realm guided by the caring, yourselves. This new reality requires a new attitude, and needs you to grow in how you are to use your new and expanding consciousness. Start every day with a firm purpose derived from your first set of meditations or prayer. Converse with others and set up a plan. The vital key is for every day to have a positive and spiritual purpose. In this way, you can really create miracles!<br /><br />Today, as always, we explored what is going on in this realm that you reside in. Learn to respect each other and the natural environment, which surrounds you. This world is quickly changing for the better and truly astounding changes are literally moments away. Be ready and be conscious of these simple facts! Know, dear Ones, that the countless Supply and never-ending Prosperity of Heaven are indeed yours! So Be It! Selamat Gajun! Selamat Ja! (Sirian for Be One! and Be in Joy!)<br /><br /><br />Website: Planetary Activation Organization   <br /><br /><br />last weeek...<br /><br />Dratzo! We come forth with news that we have long waited to tell you! The energies for the beginnings of the delivery schedule are finally at hand. This process took some divine time to achieve. Our earthly allies feel confident that a restart to all delivery programs can be put into place. The various systems required for this are now in working order and a new international banking system is ready to see that deliveries happen. Thus, the first necessary step in putting aside the old order is ready. The other connected in this supply line are ready as well to perform their various duties. Your realm is to begin a vast transformation. Your prosperity is therefore to be in your hands shortly. These exchanges of funds are quickly to create the conditions needed to bring forth new governance. This, in turn, is going to eventually permit the formal recognition of our existence. All of these various actions are finally to put you on a much faster track to full consciousness. The dark cabal’s many delaying tactics are done and we are most happy to see the termination of their vile schemes. You are approaching a new watershed in your liberation from millennia of slavery!<br /><br />   This newfound freedom is to propel you forward to a series of new revelations, which are to rapidly transform your world. A vast reset of your global currency system is to be overseen by this new global financial system. The enormous debt that this world has floated on is to disappear. In fact, debt as you have known it is to be transformed. A global jubilee is to release a great energy, which is to bring you new inventions in medicine, science and travel. These devices are to permit your various societies to conquer disease, re-invent your sciences and travel easily to the most distant parts of your world! You are to enjoy a great prosperity and receive some wonderful teachings from your Ascended Masters. This massive education is to take you away from the lies that presently “color” your world. You are to use this wisdom to get a whole host of new perceptions about your origins and learn how the cabal manipulated your realm over time. All of this new knowledge is truly to serve you well. What then remains are our landings and your repair of millennia of damage to Gaia’s surface realm.<br /><br />   What you are collectively to accomplish is to transform the world where you reside. Everywhere on your planet’s surface, the signs of your mistreatment of Gaia’s surface are evident. As this new technology comes on board, you need to adjust your concepts of how your societies operate. Manufacturing and farming need to gradually be toned down and a massive restructuring of how your cities work is to become quite vital. The re-distribution of wealth is to set in place a new definition of who you are and how you relate to Gaia. The vast amount of pollution found in Gaia’s water, land and atmosphere are to be cleaned up. What you eat and how you live needs to be looked at anew. The new governance is to supply a grand plan for these. This plan truly requires your input and suggestions. Each of you possesses an inner wisdom that needs to be fully expressed. This grand exchange can produce a real dialogue, which can produce a plan that takes all possible problems into account and easily resolves them. Out of this can be forged the actions that show how much each of you has grown.<br /><br />   When we arrive, we wish to see a global society that is assuming its many responsibilities to grow and transform. Such a society is, in effect, dynamic and capable of even more inner searching. Long ago, your ancestors were a lively group that even took on the powers that were in ancient Atlantis. It is this energy, which is to create a most original and creative galactic society. This energy was throttled, first by the Atlanteans and then by the Anunnaki and their appointed minions. A new set of energies can finally finish what the Atlanteans temporarily stopped. You are a most vibrant people who are now trapped in the age old “customs” of your much-manipulated societies. These “realities” are to be transformed and you are to return to ways that now seem impossible to you. Our wish for you is that you take this new freedom and channel it in ways that help your planet, your environment and yourselves. Hence, be prepared to open your heart and mind to those things that at present may seen somewhat “out of the ordinary.” A new world is truly at hand!<br /><br />   Namaste! We are your ascended Masters! We come, dear hearts, with good news! Our associates intend to begin deliveries of many items necessary to bring forth your abundance. These programs are to establish a new and unencumbered way of effortlessly moving these prosperity and humanitarian funds around. This system is designed to easily catch those who illegally wish to pass laundered or dirty monies. This new system ends the logjam created by the dark Cabal’s system. Many other things are being instituted as well that are to permit a new jubilee for all. It is our intent to see that new monies backed by gold are given to you. These are to be replaced shortly with a special system that makes any accumulated debt just about impossible. The key is to move toward abundance and joy! Various technologies as well are ready to be introduced, which end the days of money. This moneyless society is to emphasize the rise of the replicator.<br /><br />   These technologies are to free you from the numerous forms of debt slavery now prevalent on this world. One of the greatest tests for humanity is to learn that the universe provides what you need in abundant form. We have all, at one time or another, lived in a society in which most of us were poor and daily believed that our abundance was impossible. This belief is now to end. You are ready to learn about abundance. It takes many forms, but what is truly required is a simple positive belief that your abundance is given to you as a birthright. In fact, Heaven daily asks your inner self for what type of abundance you deem possible. Hence, be positive and deeply ask for this so the heavenly universe can comply. Thus, it is vital that you discard any concept of either unworthiness or lack. You do deserve abundance and a life where you are helped and where you help each other.<br /><br />   As we have been saying, you are a wondrous Being, deserving of all the wonder and attention that you dearly wish. Likewise, you need to bestow this energy on others. Most of all, Gaia needs your attention and support. We ask you to spread your great Love to each other. Use this time to envelope causes that aid Gaia and support each other. This is to be a time of growing wealth for you. Use this wealth to aid this world, each other and yourselves. As the dark fades, rejoice and know deeply inside what Heaven expects of you. This is, of course, divine service – simple, unselfish actions. We can cite divine parables, but this is not necessary. Be in joy and relish this time and these amazing opportunities. You can then spread a vast web of your own Light, which connects and intertwines with others! This time is thus the beginning of a most welcomed reality! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah!<br /><br />   Today we continued with our message! Let this extraordinary time start to fill you with its many special blessings! Let this time as well be one in which you rise out of stress and frustration and transform to utter joy and great success! Know, dear Ones, that the countless Supply and never-ending Prosperity of Heaven are indeed yours! So Be It! Selamat Gajun! Selamat JA! (Sirian for Be One! and Be in Joy!)<br /><br /><br />Website: Planetary Activation Organization   <br /><br /><br />PLEASE DONATE HERE!<br /><br /><br />THANK YOU! :D<br /><br /><br />===<br /><br /><br />UPDATE FROM THE GALACTIC FEDERATION -   <br /><br /><br />SaLuSa 13 March 2015 <br /><br />A whole series of changes lay ahead of you now that the dark Ones plans have been thwarted. They can no longer dictate the course of Humanities future, and can only concede their position to the Light. It has meant that progress can now more or less proceed unheeded or impeded, and activities can be more open and made known to you. There is much to do and our plans are to produce results as soon as possible. Hitherto we have had to be guarded where our they were concerned, but now we can let you know without any great fear. You will also see more of our craft openly moving through your skies, where previously we have mainly kept our cloaks of invisibility on to avoid any confrontation with your craft. We now await recognition from your political leaders but know that many are scared to be revealed for what they really are. However, in time all will be revealed and no individual will find any hiding place. The higher vibrations are no place for any lesser Beings as there comes a point when only the truth can exist. The dark Ones have had their day and in spite of all you may know about them, as with any other soul we offer them the opportunity to turn to the Light without any recriminations. They will however have a long way to go to fully recover their position in it. <br /><br />As you will have undoubtedly realised, our prime desire is to see every soul fully returning to the Light, and every opportunity will be given to them. You will notice that we do not talk about punishment for wayward souls, but compassion by giving them every chance to return to the Light. No one is beyond redemption except that they refuse to accept the opportunities we give them. All of you at some stage have walked on both sides of the Light and few of you are worse off for the experiences. Indeed, you are strengthened by them and more able to help those who have followed on in your footsteps. Now you know why we have always asked you to be non-judgemental on all such occasions. You have a saying that “but by the Grace of God go I” and thereby lies a great truth, so please do not judge those who are at different stages in their evolution. <br /><br />You are all great souls who have been to “Hell” and back again, and by this we refer to your lives in the lowest vibrations where the Light has all but been diminished. Yet you have survived to become greater beings although as yet you do not comprehend the full meaning of it. To become so separated from the Light has presented you a mammoth task to find your way back again. Yet you faced that possibility with great confidence as we promised you that we would always be there for you. We are not of course the only ones as souls from all over the Universe have wished to be part of the challenge and gain from the experience. Understand that you have re-incarnated many, many times to play your part in the great adventure that is now concluding. You have played for whatever side would best serve your interests and evolution. All life is continually evolving until all souls return to the Godhead from whence they came. Do not let this worry you as you have a long, long way to go before any such completion approaches. The ultimate is to again become One with God. <br /><br />Each one of you is playing a major part in bringing the Light to Earth, far more than you would immediately realise. We hear you question whether you could do more as you feel you have much to offer, but realise that your abilities are known to us and we are pleased with what you are doing now. Simply keep the Light shining out brightly and we could not ask a lot more from you. When you consider the number of Lightworkers doing their bit to bring the New Age in, have no doubt that your future is assured. If you are called to carry out extra tasks, that is because you are considered as some of those souls with the necessary experience and knowledge to do so. Also bear in mind that once matters really get underway, there will be more than enough to go round and keep you all engaged. We know your attributes and what you do best, so there will be no square pegs in round holes. Rejoice, the real work will soon begin and all that you have been waiting for will gradually come into being. <br /><br />Set your sight upon all that is good and wholesome, and if you are assailed by the dark Ones see them in the Light and simply go on your way. There is no need to engage in arguments, so simply make your point and move on. Prove to yourself that you have the confidence to handle whatever is presented to you, and do not give way to provocation. Some will say that is easier done than said, but you have to be prepared for whatever situations confronts you. Succumbing to the energies of fear results in the lowering of your vibrations, and the dark Ones will feed upon them. Call upon any source of Light that appeals to you in such circumstances, and know that you will be helped. You have more souls walking your path with you than you can possibly imagine. <br /><br />The Galactic Federation is being given more of a free hand to deal with matters that come up. Hitherto, we have been strictly under the command of the Hierarchy that has been responsible for the great plan for your return to the Light. As we have mentioned on more than one occasion, we are mostly operating with our cloaks of invisibility in place. We have not placed ourselves at risk of causing an incident, as it could involve innocent victims. We do not seek confrontation with the dark Ones, and would rather take avoiding action to keep the peace. We could otherwise perfectly well handle any problems, as we have advanced protection that you have no idea of at present. It is only used as a last resort as we are not looking to destroy the dark Ones, but protect you from them. <br /><br />I am SaLuSa from Sirius, and what joy it gives me to speak freely with you. Many of you have so to say “come of age” and awakened to what is required of you as a Being of Light. Together we are nearly at the end of a long road, and thank you for perseverance and commitment to the Light. <br /><br />Thank you SaLuSa. <br /><br />Mike Quinsey.    <br /><br /><br /><br />last week...<br /><br />SaLuSa March, 2015  <br /><br /><br />I bring greetings from the Galactic Forces who follow your progress with great interest, having accompanied you through many lives. However, our involvement with you has never been more intense than it is now, as you approach the end of your experiences in the old paradigm. We have come a long way together, and we admire your determination to stick to your tasks and achieve victory over the dark Ones. The fact that you have effectively already won that battle does not mean you have no further work to do, and the emphasis is now upon maintaining your position in the higher vibrations. They are your future and also protection while you keep focussed on your present role assisting the Light. We have spoken previously about your ability to stand within your own Light, and not be affected by anything going on around you. Now that you have come this far, you have created an aura that is potentially impregnable, but it does depend on you being able to keep it intact. It means not being distracted or mislead by any attempts to divert your attention elsewhere. Keeping calm in the face of situations that are a test of your strength, is the challenge that you face.<br /><br />Remember that you have come through the trials and tribulations that the 3rd. dimension has thrown at you. You have won the battle yet you still have to lift yourselves up to the higher dimensions. The dark Ones will make their last attempts to distract you but with little effort you should overcome them. By now your awakening should have enabled you to look beyond the programming that has tied you down, to see the deception that has been placed upon you. We tell you again that you are far greater than you imagine or have been led to believe. You are in reality great Beings of Light which you will again be when you merge with your Higher Self. So tell yourself that you have the full potential to be great once more, and nothing is beyond your capabilities. For too long you have laboured under the impression that you are lowly Beings and have suffered in consequence. Now you are beginning to understand why you have been held back through the actions of the dark Ones, but now their power has been diminished and you are regaining yours.<br /><br />While you are spreading the Light we as always keep a watchful eye on you, and will not allow any interference with your progress that will affect the outcome. We can do much to prevent any attempt to delay or intervene in your work, and often you are unaware of such attempts. Bear in mind that the end times are such that a lot of karma or unfinished work is carried out. Often it is left until this period of time as when you have raised your vibrations, your ability to deal with outstanding issues is that much higher. Do not belittle yourselves as you have immense potential and by projecting such a belief you empower yourselves. The Law of Attraction is powerful and a true reality but works in ways that you may not realise. You must be positive at all times, as a negative attitude will attract more of the same. By making the affirmation that you can do something rather than asking for help to do it, you will advance much quicker. Results may not always happen as quickly as you would like, but will come in good time.<br /><br />God does not play games with you but there are other Beings that for different reasons will masquerade as God and try to lead you in a different direction. Your intuitive powers should make you suspicious of such entities, particularly if you are enticed by attractive propositions. However, if you have come to terms with your ego you should recognise attempts to mislead you. Until you have fully returned to the Light you will encounter various obstacles on your path at different times. Be alert and know that God and the Higher Beings do not play games with you, and are all Love and you will know them by their Light. You may have been cut off from us, but now that the veils that have hidden the truth are being removed, you will gradually regain full understanding. Be ready to learn the greater truths about yourselves and be ready to take your place amongst us.<br /><br />Some souls are not yet ready to learn about the truth of your existence or indeed your past history, but that is not going to hold back their progress. They will be guided to a path that will take them forward and lessons will be learnt regardless of how long it takes. This is why we ask you to see the Light in all souls and never prejudge them, as you do not know what challenges they have undertaken. Coming out of the darkness into the Light is a powerful experience and souls doing so need compassion and help to be successful. Have you not been told by the great Teacher Jesus, to be careful who you entertain as you will not know when you are in the company of an Angelic Being. If you treat all people with respect and kindness you will be doing the best you can for them and yourself.<br /><br />In reality life is not complicated but in your present dimension there is a continuous battle with the lower vibrations. At every turn there is the potential challenge that may catch you off guard, yet if you are strong in your beliefs they cannot cause you any harm. There is only the one great power that is immutable and above all else and that is Love, and all you need to sail through your experiences. Love every soul and if their demeanour is such that you find it repulsive you clearly do not have to strike up a friendship with them. You have a saying “that if you cannot say anything good about someone do not say anything bad” and that is a good way of life. Like will attract like, which you have surely found and you should already have a circle of friends who you are in harmony with.<br /><br />We of the Galactic Fleets are ready to arrive on Earth within a short time of being given the command. So be assured that there will be no delay on our part once the situation is such that we can safely visit you. We do not want to directly interfere with your progress, but will follow orders given to us for you betterment. Be assured we are here for you and look forward to meeting you in peaceful circumstances.<br /><br />I am SaLuSa from Sirius, and represent the Light forces that care for you. I send you Love and best wishes for a successful end to your sojourn.<br /><br />Thank you SaLuSa.<br /> Mike Quinsey<br /> <br /><br />Last week...<br /><br /><br />SaLuSa 27 February 2015<br /><br /> You are living in dramatic times when changes are going to take place very quickly. They are going to introduce you to the New Age that will eventually change virtually all aspects of your life. They may take time to manifest but they are already taking shape, as the old set up is being dismantled. It was specifically meant to keep you in the dark and prevent you from realising your true potential. The dark Ones intentionally concealed the truth of your true heritage, but that time is now coming to a close and those souls that are enlightened are leading the way forward. It means that those who cannot release themselves from their old belief system, will gradually become more isolated. There is no shame or retribution where they are concerned, but is does mean that their next experience will be a continuation of what they have already chosen. Be assured that many helpers are with such souls, encouraging them to have the desire to lift themselves up. Since time is an illusion it does not matter how long it takes for them to awaken.<br /><br /> Do not restrict your vision of the future as this is a time when everything is possible. Open your heart to the Light and allow your love to embrace all souls, as in reality you are all One. The greatest lesson you can learn that is most important to your future is forgiveness, and it should not be limited in anyway at all. All souls have at different times experienced both the Light and the dark energies in the course of gaining the experience needed to evolve. So as you see other souls today remember that they are working to release karma, for which their roles may be played out in both the Light and dark. Judgement therefore is made without a full understanding of the issues involved and it is best to simply send such souls your love.<br /><br /> The future will see the emergence of souls who have already evolved and will help others to rise up. You may therefore have complete faith in it and for what it holds, as the future is assured and destined to take you into the New Age. Your new cycle will quickly move you into the higher vibrations and peace and contentment will soon come to all of you. It will be a time when you will no longer be held back by the dark Ones who will have been removed from the Earth. Indeed, no soul will be able to move into the higher dimensions unless they are of the higher vibrations. All these advancements are planned for you, but be patient and allow time for them to manifest. We simply tell you the good news so as to lift your spirits, as we know that many of you are tired and most keen to move on. Your release from the lower vibrations is beyond doubt, so do not despair but keep going forward in a positive manner.<br /><br /> We are fully engaged keeping the dark Ones in check as they try to make their last attempts to disrupt our plan. We are always one step ahead of them and know when they are planning to create havoc. Now that they realise their time is nearly up, their thoughts have turned to escaping the consequences of their acts, however, there is no realistic chance of that happening. They will find that their escape routes are being blocked, and they will suffer the consequence of their actions. We are not referring to man’s idea of retribution but encouragement and help to return to the Light. Rarely do souls turn their back on an opportunity to change their ways, but if not they are the makers of their own destiny and their life ending.<br /><br /> Be assured that once the situation on Earth is settled and we can freely move amongst you, we will be openly making contact. Our plans are made and ready to be put into action so as you would say, once “the coast is clear” we will be able to commence our work with you immediately. Our priority is to commence the actions required to bring about global changes, so that all currencies are gradually brought up to parity. For too long some have been greatly undervalued and they are at the top of our list. The gold standard will also be re-established and put a stop to the endless changes in the value of currencies. Such action will revive the market place and a stop will be put to profiteering.<br /><br /> We are already helping Mother Earth to stabilise and cleanse the planet, and eventually it will become as pristine and beautiful as it was originally. There is so much that is planned to restore the Earth and we are actively involved because of our superior technology. There will be changes occurring at the same time all over the Earth, and you will be surprised at the speed they are carried out. Whatever problems you have now, they will fade into the background once we can fully commence our plan. Naturally some aspects of the work will involve you all at different times, as we do want you to participate with us. So Dear Ones, do not feel downcast at the apparent slowness of the changes, as much is happening that you are unaware of at present.<br /><br /> At different times we have stepped in and put a stop to actions intended to cause harm and damage, and as we have mentioned previously, have prevented what would have been the total destruction of your Earth. So do not doubt that we can exercise powers that are beyond the ability of the dark Ones, and stop them creating a major incident. Too many times you have been at their mercy and we have been unable to intervene because of karma, but even so we have lessened the effect of their actions. We are not as you would understand it a Galactic Army but more like your Police Force who try to prevent crimes from taking place.<br /><br /> I am SaLuSa from Sirius and as ever delighted to have this contact with you. There are other contacts throughout your world, so that the news we bring can be made known to a larger number of you. Time still moves forward with ever increasing speed and you should gradually become aware of it. Eventually you will return to a “no time” existence, as you were eons of time ago before you left the higher realms. Our immense Love and Light, and our best wishes go with you wherever you are.<br /><br /> Thank you SaLuSa,<br /><br /> Mike Quinsey. <br /><br /><br /> Website: Tree of the Golden Light   <br /><br /><br />===<br /><br />PLEASE DONATE HERE!<br /><br /><br />THANK YOU! :D<br /><br /><br />===<br /><br />Please Watch popular cartoon "The Last Airbender" teaching children about Chakras:<br /><br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=02FkMr21xOA">youtube . com / watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=02FkMr21xOA</a><br /><br /> <br />The basic idea of chahkra is that there are a series of points along the middle of the body where energies gather. Those points then regulate those energies within you. It is possible for those points to become clogged or out of whack, and that "re-aligning" these chakra points can cure many ailments. It may appeal to this market for several reasons. For one, it is easy to extrapolate the 'functions' of the chakras to actual organs in the body, considering they are a bunch of lore trying to explain aspects of the human body. In addition, it has a low entry level; little needs to be bought in order to follow new age chakra woo except maybe embarrassing yoga outfits and a foam mat to carry around under your arm. Chakra woo also goes together with other kinds of woo very easily, because chakras seem to have to do with many other factors, such as diet and the body posture. Finally, chakras are pretty: thanks to American New-age marketing, they now sport all the colors of the visual light spectrum and look great in advertisements. Especially alongside crystals of convenient matching colors (also for sale). Throw in a double rainbow arcing over a tropical sunset or two for good measure while you're at it.<br /><br /> On its own, as a mystical system of enlightenment, it is no worse or better than any other. As a means of explaining treatments that seem to have some utility, it's highly dubious. As a method of diagnosis, it is bunk.<br /> (It should be noted that most of the people in the United States and the rest of the West who go on about chakras have very little training in Indian mysticism, and thus are missing out on a great deal of the philosophy and understanding behind it.)<br /><br /> There are a million names for each chakra, sub-chakras, differences in tradition, and other discrepancies. For the purposes of sanity, each here will be listed accorded to the Tantric hindu tradition. If you seriously are taken with researching more on the more complicated and detailed aspects of chakras, by all means go and check out Wikipedia's entry and related pages.<br /><br />1. Sahasrara, the Crown Chakra.<br /> This chakra is at the top of the head, and for some reason is often represented with violet (and on this page for readability reasons) when it's actually associated with white: a white lotus of one thousand petals to be precise. It's supposed to be the chakra of higher consciousness and awareness. For some reason people connect it to the pituitary gland in humans, though how hormones relate to higher consciousness is as mysterious as anything else. Traditionally, mastering meditating upon it bestows occult powers and at least partial omnipotence. Although the feats of many yogis are indeed amazing, it's highly unlikely that magic superpowers are the case.<br /><br />2. Ajna, the Brow Chakra.<br /> This indigo chakra is otherwise known as the third eye and deals with visual and perceptive consciousness. It is represented by a lotus with two petals: two petals for Shakti (female) and Shiva (male) energy, two petals for two psychic channels, and various other symbolisms. It has been associated with the pineal gland, and meditating to it is suggested to give one psychic powers. The outlook for that looks... hazy.<br /><br />3.Vishuddha, the Throat Chakra.<br /> This chakra is represented by blue, but in Tibetan Buddhism it is red. Either way, it is the chakra of expression, fluidity, independence, freedom of thought, feelings of security and all of that good stuff. It is represented with 16 petals, and it's pretty important in Dream Yoga. That is to say, meditating on it supposedly promotes lucid dreaming.<br /><br />4. Anahata, the Heart Chakra.<br /> Represented by twelve petals and a hexagram, this green chakra mandates a whole host of things. Physically it is tied to well-being, circulation, stress, and other bodily functions, and in the nonphysical realm it covers love, compassion, devotion, and other feel-good things. It is often connected to the thymus gland. It is far more important in Tibetan Buddhism, as it in that tradition also handles reincarnation. However, meditating on it allegedly allows one to body-surf, become a master of public speaking, and be dearer than the dearest to women.'[1] No scientific studies have so far located a reputable source of magic date-finding powers, however.<br /><br />5. Manipura, the Solar Plexus Chakra.<br /> This ten-petaled yellow chakra is associated with the digestive system of the body, as well as all manner of growth physical and spiritual. This includes issues of growth and change, such as power, fear, and forming opinions. Mastering meditating on it is said to bestow the occult power to create and destroy the world. Thank goodness nobody's actually gotten good at meditating on it yet.<br /><br />6. Swadhisthana, the Sacral Chakra.<br /> Associated with the testes or ovaries, this six-petaled orange chakra is said to preside over adrenal hormones in general. Spiritually, it's supposed to govern things like desire, basic human needs, violence, creativity, and happiness. It is a troublesome chakra in the tradition, and many holy figures have supposedly suffered under its sexual temptations. Mastering meditating to it supposedly quells fears of drowning and allows the invoker to taste anything they want. Next to the whole 'destroy the world' power this seems a bit of a sham.<br /><br />7. Muladhara, the Root Chakra.<br /> Located in the base of the spine, in the pelvis, is this four-petaled chakra. It is famously associated with the actual sex organs and sensuality as well as flight-or-fight response and simple survival. It competes with the Sacral Chakra for which is the sexiest chakra. This chakra doesn't exist in Tibetan Buddhism. Mastering this chakra is said to make the invoker a king of all men: knowing everything and immune to all diseases.[4]<br /><br /> Other Chakras<br /> There are many, many minor chakras and lesser chakras as well as sub-chakras and other artifacts. Not even experts are sure how many there are in total. It's safe to say that when cultures make up many congruent spiritual traditions, the result will be as numerous as there are people to claim mastery over that tradition.<br /><br /> <br />===<br /> <br />IF YOU NEED PROTECTION @ ANY TIME! :D<br /> <br />REMEMBER to CALL MY NAME!!!!!!!!!!!! = CALL ARCHANGEL MICHAEL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /> <br />SAY EVERY DAY: I AM ARCHANGEL MICHAEL FULLY &amp; ABSOLUTLY PROTECTED<br /> <br /> <br />===<br /><br />Montague Keen - March 8, 2015   <br /><br />People are finding the courage to say NO to the control and corruption that they have been victims of for 2000 years. To implement their plans for a New World Order, they first had to destroy IRELAND. Until you look at this, you cannot move forward. You need to see WHO and WHY. The Irish are seeing this control for the first time and THEY ARE ANGRY. They are marching to show their strength. They are saying NO. Now, they are beginning to see why they have been used and abused by those who wish to take over your world.<br /><br /> Yes, it is hard to believe that so much could have been done to dumb down the human race without you ever suspecting. It was a clever plot. It needed to be concealed from you. Religion played a huge part in this. The take over was planned at the Council of Nicea, nearly 2000 years ago. The Vatican and her elected 'princes' of the church; the Knights of Malta etc, are behind every WAR, FAMINE, and OUTBREAK OF ILLNESS, and everything you have endured ever since. It is the greatest CON since Man began to walk the Earth. Do not be blinded by all the pomp and ceremony; it is camouflage, designed to hide its true intent.<br /><br /> You are now casting light on London. People are publically exposing corruption. This would not have happened a year ago. You are beginning to see how powerful you are. Just by using your energy to send love and light, you can make a huge difference. You can bring about the changes necessary for the transition to peace and harmony. Your light is exposing all that is dark and corrupt.<br /><br /> Once the Irish people realise who they are, and what was taken from them – their true history – then the whole plan with be revealed, including the take over of the Earth and the introduction of the NEW WORLD ORDER. Believe me, the answer lies in Ireland. This is why Rome has controlled Ireland unmercifully. It created what you were told was a potatoe famine: it was most certainly a HOLOCAUST. You will find ample evidence for this. The JESUITS, with the assistance of the British Crown, are responsible for the deaths of thousands of Irish people. They sold the Irish as SLAVES in Africa. They wanted to destroy the Irish race completely. But the Irish are survivors. They pick themselves up and start again. Now, the freedom of the world is in their hands.<br /><br /> The Irish government does not serve the Irish people. IT SERVES ROME. It cannot even pass a law without the approval of Rome. The Irish government can only do what the Vatican will allow it to do. So its hands are tied. The boot of the Vatican has been on the throat of the Irish people for 2000 years. It is time for you to understand just who is in control. It is not the puppets; they are just playing a role.<br /><br /> Rome sent the imposter, St Patrick, to destroy all evidence of the great minds who inhabited Ireland. This is where the corruption of humanity began. You cannot heal a problem until you understand what caused it in the first place. Please understand that the first steps to create a New World Order were implemented in what you now call Ireland.<br /><br /> There are artificial intelligence machines, rather like computers, all over your world. They control you. They control your minds and your thoughts, and they keep you docile. They prevent you from thinking for yourselves and they lock you into the matrix. These A.I.s use the energy of the ley lines. This is why I asked you to work on releasing this energy for humanity. As a result of your efforts, information that had been kept secret is now flowing out, and it is exposing corruption.<br /><br /> Please send your love and light to London. People have suffered enough. The spirit world weeps for humanity. It is doing everything possible to release you from bondage. Ask for help, as we cannot interfere unless asked to do so. There are many around your planet awaiting your call. This time was planned. Those who are on the Earth now, planned to be here in order to help you take the leap of faith to truth and love. Allow your souls to connect with the Irish people as they march. For each one of you, no matter where you are in the world, needs them to succeed. Your future depends on it. They will free humanity. You all depend on their success.<br /><br /> You need to free your minds from the control grid and think for yourselves. Do not buy into the lies that enslave you. See things as they are, not as you are told they are. This is important to remember. The more you wake up, the less power the NWO will have over you.<br /><br /> Support each other, whenever possible, and come together as one. For therein lies your power. Your time has come. Make it easy on yourselves by working together. Change has to happen now, and the faster it happens, the fewer casualties there will be.<br /><br /> The adventure has begun in Ireland. All the other countries will follow, but it had to begin there. Call on Source to give you the strength to do whatever is necessary to bring peace to the world. When you think about it, how could 1% possibly hope to take over from the other 99%, without the compliance of that majority. The ball is in your court. You have the strength to say, NO, I will not support your corrupt intentions !<br /><br /> Love and light to London. Energy to Ireland, to enable them to open their eyes and minds to the truth.<br /><br /> My dear, these things are done to create fear. See these attacks for what they are. These are the last stumbling blocks on the way to freedom. Humanity is awakening, and its light is overtaking the darkness.<br /><br /> I am with you always. Your adoring, Monty.<br /><br /><br />Website: The Montague Keen Foundation <br /><br />last week...<br /><br /><br />Monty's message today via his wife, Veronica <br /> 8 February 2015 - 10:22pm <br /><br /> Channeler: <br /> Veronica Keen <br /> 08/02/2015<br /><br /> "The crisis that is being deliberately created in your world is also exposing those who do not have humanity's best interests at heart. There is no mistaking now, who is in the pay of the dark cabal. They are demanding war. I did tell you in the past that the cabal cannot exist without war. You can now plainly see how desperate they are, as they rush from one country to another, pleading for war.Now that you are awake, you can see exactly what is happening. This scares them, as they have not had to deal with such dissent before. They do not just want war; they need war. But the innocent people of the Ukraine do not deserve what is being visited upon them. They need your support. It is Ukraine, today: it could be you, tomorrow !<br /><br />The cabal wants to cull the population. They will show no mercy. They want to bring their plans to a conclusion with their New World Order, at any cost. You, mere humans, are in the way. So they want to dispose of you. I implore you, do not kill your own species to enable this cabal to take over Planet Earth. As I have pointed out many times before, they cannot do it without your assistance. This is a critical time for you. Decisions must be made: do you do nothing and wait to be culled, or do you make a stand and support your fellow man. There is no fence to sit on. The time has come for action. You were warned, over and over again, that this time was coming. Now, it is upon you, so serious decisions must be made. You have heard the LIES of the cabal throughout history. "Weapons of Mass Destruction" that NEVER EXISTED: but you fell for it.<br /><br />Those who stand for TRUTH in this situation, deserve your respect. Do not watch their LIES on television or in the newspapers. You KNOW the truth which makes their lies look so pathetic. The planet and humanity need your support. You are many, they are few. Look deeply into their faces as they speak in front of the camera; it is so obvious that they are LYING. Such lies cannot be hidden in the light. Their paymasters do not like the delay, for they do not tolerate failure. So the pathetic puppets are very worried indeed . . . and so they should be !<br /><br />Do not give your consent to World War III. Nor to the invasion of other countries, no matter what you are told. The cabal cannot do it without your consent. This one FACT, puts all of you in a position of power. This information was kept hidden from you until now. When you vote, you give your power to another person, to act on your behalf. You must now withdraw that power. Believe in yourselves and take back your power from the puppets of the cabal. The sooner you come together, and refuse to kill or invade other countries, the sooner peace will prevail and life on Earth will become a joy, rather than a trial of strength and a struggle to survive. When you LAUGH at the LIES of the puppets, they will know that their game is up. The survival of humanity and Planet Earth is in your hands.<br /><br />In the past, you have managed to turn a blind eye to so much corruption, pedophilia, and unlawful killing, etc. The abuse of little children continued, because good men failed to protect them. You know enough now, to enable you to expose such behaviour. It is time for change. You are the people designated to bring this change about, and it will be easier than you expect.<br /><br />My dear wife had another severe psychic attack as she got up this morning. It drained her energy and her eyes are very painful. This particular form of attack happens almost every day, but she continues her work. There is also a plan for her to have an "accident". Should such an incident occur, then know without doubt, that it was not an accident. The cabal really does not want you to wake up and see what they are up to. They will stop at nothing to hold on to power and continue to enjoy the fruits of your labour. They have removed all the joy from living a life on Earth. But you will come through this terrible time.<br /><br />It is all coming to a head. The cabal wants a war in the Ukraine. SO THEY NEED YOU TO GIVE IT TO THEM.<br /><br />Send love and light to all the people and countries that suffer at the hands of the cabal. Their chemtrails have become even more lethal, especially in America. They are killing you, every day. You may think you are falling ill;when in fact, you are being killed off. This is how bad it is. Please wake up !<br /><br />Reach out to each other, and help when needed. Be ready to stand together for light and truth. Use the power of meditation, or use your thoughts, to bring about the changes necessary for humanity to step into the light. Ask for help. We, and your friends from other planets, cannot intervene unless we are invited.<br /><br />It would have been my birthday, yesterday, had I survived. Veronica felt sad without me on such a day. I hold the memories of the wonderful birthdays she gave me when I was on Earth.<br /><br />It is a time of great change. Each one of you, chose to be on Earth at this time, to bring about all these changes. Both sides of life will celebrate when peace and harmony are restored.<br /><br />My love is with you always. Your adoring, Monty."<br /><br />montaguekeen . com<br /><br /><br />Website: The Montague Keen Foundation <br /><br /><br /><br /> <br />===<br /> <br />MSG from APOSTLE MATTHEW from BIBLE<br /> <br />With loving greetings from all souls at this station, this is Matthew.  We have been asked if the Illuminati have any role in the fighting going on in Ukraine and what ISIS is doing. Yes, major roles in both, but since they are “behind the scene,” so to say, they aren’t historically or currently attributed to the Illuminati. The unrest in Ukraine stems from wars they initiated long ago to form new national borders without any regard for the differing cultures and history of the affected peoples, and ISIS’ goal of creating an Islamic State has its emotional roots in wars started in Afghanistan and Iraq by Illuminati within the United States government.<br /><br />Now Russian President Vladimir Putin, US President Barack Obama, and some national leaders in the Mideast and Europe are trying to quell inflammatory situations instigated by Illuminati-controlled CIA agents who created incidents to incite the citizenry, carried out by Illuminati-“owned” mercenaries and unwitting troops, and funded by the Illuminati’s illegally-acquired massive resources.<br /><br />Please keep foremost in your thoughts that turbulence is running out its various energetic courses and the increasing energy momentum of positive change is moving your society ever closer to a peaceful, harmonious world. It is helpful to remember, too, that you lightworkers and members of our universal family—the vanguard of progress—are aided by vast numbers of your populace.<br /><br />All except a comparative handful of individuals are loving, compassionate, honest people who endeavor to make life better for their families and communities or they go to countries to help the many who are in dire straits or they support efforts to protect your environment and wildlife. Simply by living from their hearts, these millions upon millions of souls are adding immeasurably to the light that ultimately will prevail throughout your entire civilization.<br /><br />Our mentioning Nirvana’s “fourth density residential area” elicited a number of responses. We thank the reader whose questions are cited, and our reply also will address comments and questions from others who wrote.<br /><br />“Matthew said, ‘Persons who advance from third to fourth density spiritually and consciously during Earth lifetime enter Nirvana’s fourth density residential areas.’ He also said residents there range from second to fifth density or higher. How do the areas where they live differ from fourth? Who decides where people live? Are family members reunited in the area where the first one who went there is? Are people restricted to their area or can they move from one to another? What kind of living accommodations do residents have? What do people do while they’re there and how long do they stay? I’d like to know more about what to expect when I get there!” <br /><br />First, as a reminder, we number densities, whether mass or location or soul evolvement status, ONLY to indicate advancement. Densities aren’t compartmentalized and there are no sign posts indicating where one density stops location-wise and another begins, and the same is true of soul evolvement. In both there are many gradations, which you could think of as shades on a color chart that move from the faintest tinge all the way up the spectrum to the color’s full intensity. Applying that to residency in Nirvana, persons who are the least evolved spiritually and consciously live in “tinge” and persons who are more evolved live in the shades that correspond to their status.<br /><br />Now then, at the end of physical lifetime, all of Earth’s peoples go to that multidimensional spirit world, thus it encompasses religions’ concepts of both heaven and hell. Nirvana comprises numerous meandering, energetically-connected, flexible “layers,” which can be considered heaven, and a tiny dense orb that is separate from the layers can be considered hell. Both are about the same distance from Earth as your moon. The layers are what you call “discarnate,” and even though they do have mass, their high vibrations make them invisible to your telescopes and the orb is too small to be noticeable.<br /><br />First we shall speak about the layers and their gradations, all of which are at varying vibratory rates, and who goes where is determined by the laws of physics that govern this universe. The energy of every person’s thoughts, motives and deeds throughout the lifetime is registered in the infallible Akashic records, and when the dense body dies, the etheric body automatically is drawn to the part of Nirvana that corresponds to the energy in the person’s records.<br /><br />We remind you as well that the soul is freed, or liberated, from the etheric body—it is the personage and its lifetime experiences, which form the psyche, who goes to Nirvana. So it is possible, even likely, that members of an Earth family will enter different parts, but all who go to the layers may visit each other. As members in lower layers or layer gradations grow in spiritual and conscious awareness, they advance accordingly in residency.<br /><br />Nirvana is in the timeless continuum, so you’ll be seeing not only family and friends from this lifetime who are there, but also dear ones from other lifetimes, and you may prefer to spend time with them. Always the stronger love bonds between individuals prevail and everyone honors this; the same applies to persons who remarried after their spouses died and all are in Nirvana.<br /><br />Now we shall speak about who lives where. Occupants of the topmost layer are the most highly evolved: the 100-member council that oversees Nirvana’s administrative aspects, resident and visiting masters in specialty fields, and universal family members who wish to stay a while after completing their volunteer service on Earth. Down a notch are the principals in charge of transition, customized healing and settling-in assistance; childcare; education; employment; transportation; architecture and construction; entertainment; Earth monitoring; libraries and the fine arts.  Then come the myriad employees in those and other fields who live in layer gradations commensurate with their extent of responsibility and progress in service, spiritual and conscious growth, and personal interests.<br /><br />Although education at every level and training in all fields are available to everyone, skills and talents of other personage lifetimes are remembered, so residents have a wealth of knowledge and experience to choose from. Always employment is a matter of choice, and individuals who desire to work may change from one field to another whenever they wish.<br /><br />Babies and young children enter fourth density. If close family members are living there or in higher layers, the children join them; if not, they are lovingly nurtured by specially-trained caretakers and schooled appropriately for age and soul growth status at the time they arrived.<br /><br />Animals also enter fourth density. Those whom you call predators were herbivores before darkness made them carnivorous long ages ago, and that aspect of their nature is erased from cellular patterning during the passage from Earth to Nirvana. Pets and their human families are reunited by the energy streamers of shared love bonds. If pets arrive first, they roam with other animals until a family member enters any of the layers. Henceforth they may live together if that is what is desired—all animals are self-sufficient and there is no pet ownership as you know it.<br /><br />Third density is home to people who refuse to listen to universal truths that differ from their beliefs and to people whose characteristics such as bigotry, greed, anger, dishonesty, jealousy, arrogance, egotism or disloyalty led them astray from their chosen karmic lessons. All of those individuals need time and assistance to become open to enlightenment and gain spiritual and psychic strength. As they respond, they move to a higher gradation, where advanced learning and a wider range of employment, activities and growth opportunities are available, and so on up the ladder.<br /><br />Please don’t think that life in Nirvana is all work, work, work or learn, learn learn! Just as on Earth, most residents want the self-satisfaction that comes with being productive and creative and adding to their knowledge; and because they also enjoy leisure time, a wide range of age-related activities and entertainment are available. All team and individual sports except those that destroy or injure life are popular; so are attending or participating in films, theater and concerts; and “story hour” is enjoyed by all ages. There are travels throughout the realm, lectures by visiting “professors,” grand fiestas and small social get-togethers, splendid museums and art galleries, and hobbies of interest.<br /><br />Buildings of all sizes and designs are erected by focused thought and visualization, and although residences are in accordance with evolvement status, everyone has a choice of house or apartment in a city or living in a rural environment. It is noteworthy that the most highly evolved souls choose humble dwellings and people who choose mansions later feel uncomfortable with such opulence—they have those homes dematerialized and replaced with more modest styles.<br /><br />Now we shall speak about second density, the tiny dense orb that can be considered the hell of religions. The individuals drawn there are those who consistently ignored conscience and pre-birth agreements and they willfully caused great suffering to persons whose soul contracts did not include those experiences. Because light is anathema to these individuals, only a pinpoint is directed into their dark world; as they overcome their fear of the pinpoint, a bit more light is beamed to them. It may take hundreds or even thousands of your years before they choose to absorb enough light to embody at the lowest consciousness level in a third density civilization, a life comparable to Earth’s slugs and minute, short-lived insects. This act of divine grace wipes clean the cellular and psychic patterning of devastating behavior choices.<br /><br />Although Nirvana primarily is the temporary home of people who transition from Earth, residents in the higher layers vary considerably. Mother, my description of the population answers other questions sent to you, and I think it will be of interest all readers, so please insert that.<br /><br />[Excerpt from “Residents” chapter of Matthew, Tell Me about Heaven; Matthew transmitted this information in 1994, when he still lived in Nirvana.]<br /><br />     Matthew, how many souls live in Nirvana? <br /><br />Between 10 and 12 billion.  We come and go continuously, so the population fluctuates.  You’re having a hard time with that number, Mother.  Why?<br /><br />     It seems like a lot of souls between Earth lifetimes.<br /><br />I need to clarify our population, which is considerably more varied than I’ve explained. This realm is primarily for people transitioning from Earth lifetimes, who could be called “regular” residents, but many others live here, too, and I’ll tell you about all of them.<br /><br />Although most of our regular residents are preparing for their next lifetime on Earth, depending upon the stage of their soul growth, some are preparing for incarnate or discarnate life elsewhere, even outside our galaxy, or they may choose to experience as free spirits. Probably 20 years is average for a “long-timer,” but I’m not really comfortable giving that figure because many variables influence the length of residency.  Some souls feel great sensitivity in all aspects, an ability acquired only in higher density vibrations, and they don’t stay very long.  Some are so highly evolved that they practically whisk through to their next growth placement.<br /><br />Others of this spiritual evolvement status may choose to remain here quite a while. They have earned this as a reward for honored service, and they stay for a long time by your calculations.  Some of these souls are very high in our hierarchy. Other long-timers are here for intensive healing from a number of difficult lifetimes. They stay in an environment of tranquility as long as they need to recuperate before choosing their next level of spiritual growth experiencing. All those souls constitute what I referred to as our “regular” population.<br /><br />Another large part is transient.  Some are free spirits, who come and go as their growth needs require.<br /><br />     Matthew, excuse me, please.  Remember, here free spirits are folks who seem to go blithely through life doing their own thing out of the “mainstream.”  Is it the same there?<br /><br />Oh, no, Mother.  Free spirit can mean only that no body, not even the etheric body, is necessary for residence of the soul.  But in a larger sense it refers to the mental attitude or psychic approach to communion with God and the knowledgeable accomplishing of the pre-birth chosen mission.  Either or both of these conditions constitute a free spirit lifetime.  It’s a different sort of learning process and is as necessary as any other lesson due to karmic cause and effect.<br /><br />     I see.  Thank you. <br /><br />You’re welcome!  Now then, others of our transients are teachers in specialty fields or students who come for selected education, and they leave when they have accomplished their purpose.  Visitors come from other discarnate realms to further their spiritual growth and stay as long as their specific interests last.  And there are many short-term vacationers, some from supra-human civilizations.  Nirvana is much more beautiful than many other discarnate realms and, just like resorts on Earth, it attracts “tourists.”<br /><br />There is still another kind of resident here, souls who have taken on new bodies on Earth, but they reside here as well as there.  Mother, this isn’t “weird” at all, and there is good reason for these “dual” lives.  When one is motivated toward studies, learning can be achieved far more rapidly here than on Earth. We have almost limitless superb resources and master teachers, and the entire environment is conducive to spiritual growth.  What better place to gain knowledge and spiritual enlightenment with which to endow the new personage?<br /><br /> <br /><br />Thank you, Mother. We have given an enlightening glimpse of life in Nirvana, but no message can cover all facets of that world, like the personal reception of all arrivals and how they are affected by the thoughts and feelings of their loved ones on Earth; the customized care given to all who arrive with traumatized psyches; the diverse environment in that spirit world; its republic form of governance; aging and de-aging; or the range of residents’ manifesting capabilities. Although our messages never have been a platform for recommending the Matthew books, we make this one exception: Matthew, Tell Me about Heaven offers comfort to people grieving the loss of a loved one and is an inspirational guideline for living.<br /><br />Light beings throughout this universe are cheering you ever onward and embracing you with unconditional love.<br /><br />_______________________<br /><br /> <br /><br />LOVE and PEACE<br /><br />Suzanne Ward<br /> Website: The Matthew Books<br /><br /><br />===<br /><br />PLEASE DONATE HERE!<br /><br /><br />THANK YOU! :D<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />===<br /><br /><br />&lt;3 Sign-UP! to Get more INFO about "SPIRITUAL CONFERENCE with ASHTAR &amp; Other Great SPIRITUAL MASTERS @ <br />www  .  IAMabsoluteHEALING  .  COM<br /><br />&lt;3   check out  weekly ~ LISTEN to Our Latest RADIO SHOW @ <br /><br /><br />UPcoming + Archive at: <br /><br /> <a href="http://www ." target="_blank" class="txt1" rel="nofollow">www .</a> blogtalkradio . com / weareallonemovie<br /><br /><br />.<br />DONATE HERE!<br /><br />THANK YOU!<br /><br />THANK YOU!<br /><br />THANK YOU! :D <br /><br />===<br /><br />Here's the info about our upcoming radio Shows:<br /> <br /><br /><br />Saturday, March 14th, 2015<br /><br /><a href="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/weareallonemovie/2015/02/1/lord-ashtar-sheran-radio-show-weekly-on-saturdays-2013">blogtalkradio.com/weareallonemovie/2015/03/15/lord-ashtar-sheran-radio-show-weekly-on-saturdays-2013</a><br /><br /><br /> <br />&gt;&gt;&gt;Latest Radio Shows at:<br /><br /><br />go to:  <a href="http://www ." target="_blank" class="txt1" rel="nofollow">www .</a> DirectoryOfUSA.COM<br /><br />&gt; If YOU ENJOYED the above.

How pleased we are to be in your presence today. We honour you for doing the sacred task of coming to anchor the energies of the group and, of course, when we say group we mean not only those who are in the room at this time, but also those who will be experiencing this transmission on your internet, at a later time.<br /><br />By this time you are well aware that there have been profound energetic changes in you over the past twelve years on your planet, but especially since mid 2012. You are all very aware that you have been shifting and evolving, releasing, and moving back into your energetic truth. There has been much work that has gone on to release anything that was blocking you from your inner core.<br /><br />This has been an arduous process for many of you, but it is also a very sacred process, and it has been creating the foundational energetics necessary to enable you to move forward in earnest for the entirety of your life expression, in a far more empowered, enlightened, and authentically embodied way.<br /><br />Besides the vast cellular energetic changes that you have been evolving through, you have been spiritual seekers for many, many lifetimes, preparing for the times that you are in now. You have been exposed to many different belief systems, you have been reexamining what is your truth. And as so many of your old belief systems, old religious beliefs, old conditioning, have been being released, you are becoming acquainted with your authentic self, and from this process of getting to know your authentic self, you are discovering the profound divinity that has always been your truth.<br /><br />You are discovering that you are a sacred, vital and beloved aspect of Source energy. You’ve been stripping away the layers to get in touch with your very own mastery and understanding that your mastery is yours and yours alone. You have come to the point where you understand that there are many different paths that lead to personal mastery, and all that really matters is that you have found one that works well for you and your personal soul’s agenda.<br /><br />You have become acquainted with your inner guidance system, with the master that exists inside each and every one of you that, if you take the time to still yourself and listen, will always lead you effortlessly to your next best evolutionary step, and from that place of mastery you are finally beginning to step forward with certainty. This is what we would like to discuss with you today - the power of certainty.<br /><br />Certainty is what lies beyond fear and doubt. It is the promised land beyond your ego, or your small self. When you can approach your life from a place of certainty, you become a powerful, conscious creator. Think of it for a moment. Every perceived problem that you have ever felt stuck with has likely come from insecurity, not owning your authentic power, fear, doubt, trying to please others, when all along your inner guidance system has been nudging you, beckoning you, begging you, in some cases, to move forward in the way that honours you. Because you have done such an adept job at stripping away all of these old ways of being, you are now finally to a point where you can start to navigate your path with the mastery of certainty.<br /><br />Certainty is a very grounded energy. It knows what you know, and it listens to that inner voice. Certainty is not concerned with what other people are doing. Certainty understands that your mastery applies to you, that you are the only expert on you, and that every other human being on the planet is their own expert of their own life expression.<br /><br />Certainty knows that you can move forward in the way that feels best to you and that it will always take you to your highest good. Certainty is not caught up on having an attachment to an outcome because when you walk a path of mastery and certainty you know that things are always unfolding in a way that is divinely perfect. You are simply certain of what is right for you.<br /><br />Certainty is not inflexible. It makes decisions in each Now moment based on what will best honour you. It listens to the truth of you in each Now moment, and that is what makes the difference between certainty and needing to be right, or righteousness. The need to be right or righteous can be very rigid. It doesn’t flow, and it often will attempt to put one’s beliefs upon another. Certainty simply knows that you know how to proceed in the way that is best for you.<br /><br />Certainty is a powerful manifestation tool. When you are using the law of attraction, when you are co-creating with spirit, when you are consciously creating for yourself, when you have certainty that it will absolutely be so, is when you energetically anchor it into your existence in that moment. Certainty is a great magnetizer. It is an activator. It calmly and assuredly announces your intention without diluting it with the energies of fear, or doubt, or trying to please others.<br /><br />It is a pure and solid emanation of your intention. It is a pure and solid declaration of who you are and how you wish to express yourself. It is powerful. This explains why people can manifest small things and struggle with larger things. You are certain that you can manifest a cup of coffee. You are not so certain that you can manifest something of great value. That is the only difference.<br /><br />Some of you come into the body with a complete certainty of what your purpose is. You see this frequently with performers. Most performers come into their life expression very clearly knowing what their gift to the world is. You will hear their parents say, “Oh, they were singing and dancing as soon as they could walk or talk. And there is never a doubt in their mind that that is what they are meant to do. They follow their passion, for them there is no other option. It is a highly activated path of certainty, that of the performer, and this is why they are successful. It never even enters their mind that it won’t happen for them - it is simply what they do and who they are.<br /><br />Stepping forward in your certainty is you embracing your mastery. It is you holding a pure and consistent energy that honours who you really are at all times. If you are having a problem in your life that you can’t seem to evolve beyond, we would suggest to you it is because you are not certain about it. So, we would advise you to get in touch with your inner being and look for that guidance within, and strip away all of the things that are giving you reason to doubt, to fear, to be unsure.<br /><br />It is your certainty that is a demonstration of your mastery. And as other people struggle in their lives as they haven’t quite stepped onto their enlightenment path yet, it will give you a beautiful guiding energy that they will seek. Because you are all, in the end, seeking your own divinity, and then embracing the joy that comes from expressing it with certainty.<br /><br />Embrace your authentic power. Embrace the beauty of the fact that you are an enlightening human being, and a vital part of this ascension process on your planet. The gift of coming beyond the energies of March 2015 will be that you will have far greater clarity than ever before, with energies that are matching your creations like never before. It is time to start leading your life with your certainty, with your mindfulness, with your beingness, with your divinity leading the way, and it is from there that all great things will fall into place for you. This is what you’ve been working toward for so long. We urge you to savour and enjoy it, because you are truly starting to see the fruits of your labour, and it is a delight for us to behold. This is what we wished to share with you today. It has been our great pleasure.<br /><br />Archangel Gabriel thru Shelley Young<br /> <a href="http://www.trinityesoterics.com" target="_blank" class="txt1" rel="nofollow">www.trinityesoterics.com</a>   <br /><br /><br /><br />N A M A S T E<br /><br />.<br /><br />.
