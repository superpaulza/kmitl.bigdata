    <p>ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. &#8212; A multi-organizational team is 
      adapting for DOE use a technology that can help keep security 
      adversaries out of DOE sites that contain nuclear assets.</p>
    <p>The DOE Office of Security and Safety Performance Assurance 
      (SSA) is exploring the potential to use directed energy 
      weapons technology sponsored by the Department of Defense 
      (DoD), named Active Denial Technology (ADT), to help protect 
      DOE nuclear assets. </p>
    <p>SSA is sponsoring Sandia National Laboratories, a National 
      Nuclear Security Administration lab, to investigate how 
      the technology can be used on adversaries by developing 
      a new small-sized Active Denial System (ADS) to meet the 
      unique and rapidly evolving security needs of DOE.</p>
    <p>To help solve the many technical issues associated with 
      this challenge, Sandia has partnered with Raytheon and the 
      Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), because both organizations 
      have significant experience with earlier ADS system developments.</p>
	
	<p>ADS systems are a new class of nonlethal weaponry using 
      95 GHz-millimeter-wave directed energy. This technology 
      is capable of rapidly heating a person&#8217;s skin to achieve 
      a pain threshold that has been demonstrated by AFRL human 
      subject testing to be very effective at repelling people, 
      without burning the skin or causing other secondary effects. 
    </p>
    <p>The device is an alternative to lethal force. </p>
    <p>In the mid 1990s the Air Force funded development of an 
      ADT system demonstrator that was led by AFRL and built by 
      Raytheon in partnership with Communications &amp; Power 
      Inc. (CPI) and Malibu Research. The success of this demonstration 
      system has resulted in several ongoing DoD-sponsored projects, 
      such as the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Directorate&#8217;s 
      Vehicle Mounted Active Denial System (VMADS) and the Office 
      of Force Transformation&#8217;s (OFT&#8217;s) project SHERIFF.</p>

	<p>Steve Scott, manager of Sandia&#8217;s Access Delay Technology 
      Department, says, &#8220;DOE and Sandia have been closely 
      tracking ADT developments and have recognized its potential 
      to enhance the protection of DOE nuclear facilities. This 
      has been confirmed by conducting a feasibility study in 
      2002, under the supervision of researcher Jim Pacheco.&#8221; 
    </p>
    <p>Acting on the feasibility study&#8217;s conclusions, SSA&#8217;s 
      Carl Pocratsky (SO-20) initiated an effort at Sandia to 
      explore and develop a small Active Denial System (ADS) that 
      is more suitable for DOE fixed-site applications. To date, 
      DoD efforts have focused on larger systems, considered by 
      many to be better suited for military applications at extended 
      ranges. </p>
    <p>In 2004, the AFRL&#8217;s Human Effectiveness Directorate 
      (HEDR) completed a study that analyzed pre-existing test 
      data to estimate the potential effectiveness of an ADS that 
      has a smaller beam. Also in 2004, Sandia conducted simulations 
      of how the smaller ADS might be used and how it would perform 
      against adversary attack scenarios within a DOE facility 
      using the Joint Conflict and Tactical Simulation (JCATS) 
      software modeling tool.</p>
    <p>&#8220;The results of the AFRL small beam ADS effectiveness 
      study and the JCATS study were very encouraging and provided 
      a strong basis for continuing the development of a comparitively 
      small ADS for DOE fixed-site applications,&#8221; says Pacheco.</p>
    <p>&#8220;Recently there has been significant progress with 
      this project,&#8221; says Willy Morse, Sandia&#8217;s principal 
      investigator. &#8220;On May 5 we took acceptance of the 
      SSA ADS prototype system built by Raytheon&#8217;s Advanced 
      Electromagnetic Technologies (AET) Center in partnership 
      with CPI and Malibu Research. Initial characterization and 
      performance tests were completed at the end of May.&#8221;</p>
    <p>On May 19 a memorandum of understanding was completed between 
      DOE-SSA, Sandia, DoD-OFT, and AFRL. This memorandum establishes 
      a formal partnership between the DoD and DOE in developing 
      small-sized ADSs. During the next six months the AFRL&#8217;s 
      Human Effectiveness Directorate, Brooks City-Base, is being 
      funded by the OFT to complete human effects testing. This 
      testing will use the SSA ADS system to determine its effectiveness 
      for DOD applications and validate the conclusions of the 
      2004 small-beam-size effectiveness study sponsored by SSA. 
    </p>
    <p>Testing results from Sandia, AFRL, and OFT will guide the 
      operational concept and design of a second-generation small-size 
      ADS system expected to be fielded at several DOE nuclear 
      facilities as early as 2008. DOE-SSA and Sandia will continue 
      to actively seek opportunities to collaborate with other 
      government agencies on technical issues associated with 
      developing and deploying ADS systems.</p>
    <p><strong>System uses beam of electromagnetic energy to heat 
      human</strong><br />
      Active Denial Technology (ADT) provides an effective nonlethal 
      active-response mechanism to disperse, disturb, distract, 
      and establish the intent of intruders. </p>
    <p>ADT emits a 95 GHz non-ionizing electromagnetic beam of 
      energy that penetrates approximately 1/64 of an inch into 
      human skin tissue, where nerve receptors are concentrated. 
      Within seconds, the beam will heat the exposed skin tissue 
      to a level where intolerable pain is experienced and natural 
      defense mechanisms take over.</p>
    <p>This intense heating sensation stops only if the individual 
      moves out of the beam&#8217;s path or the beam is turned 
      off. The sensation caused by the system has been described 
      by test subjects as feeling like touching a hot frying pan 
      or the intense radiant heat from a fire. Burn injury is 
      prevented by limiting the beam&#8217;s intensity and duration. 
    </p>
    <p>DoD-sponsored millimeter-wave human effectiveness testing, 
      initiated in 2001, has demonstrated ADT as both effective 
      and safe without any long-term effects. It is expected that 
      the DoD-funded human effectiveness testing of the small-beam 
      ADS by the AFRL HEDR during the next six to eight months 
      will validate its effectiveness and safety as a nonlethal 
      weapon system.</p>
