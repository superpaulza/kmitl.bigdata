<p>&quot;The aircraft's contact with French radar, French air traffic controllers, ended at 10:53 a.m. at an altitude of about 6,000 feet. The plane then crashed,&quot; Germanwings' Managing Director Thomas Winkelmann told a press conference. However, tracking sites including Flightradar24 showed a similar eight-minute descent but said last contact with the flight was at 10:40 local time (6:40 a.m. ET).</p><p>There were conflicting reports over whether the flight sent out a distress call. Weather conditions in the area of the crash were good at the time the plane went down, and Germanwings said the captain of the plane had logged more than 6,000 flight hours on the Airbus.</p><p>French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve immediately flew to the region, telling reporters once he landed that &quot;exceptional measures&quot; were put in place to assist in the rescue and investigation.</p><p>Ten helicopters and one military aircraft were being mobilized and bolstering the troops, national police and nearly 300 firemen on the scene, he said.</p><p>As rescue efforts were underway Tuesday, officials in the nearby town of Digne <a href="https://twitter.com/mairiedigne/status/580329898620940288">urged people not to approach the crash zone.</a> The gymnasium in another nearby town, Seyne-les-Alpes, was being set up to take in bodies or survivors from the crash, the town confirmed to NBC News.</p><p></p><div class="stack-inline-video">

<p>French Prime Minister Manuel Valls expressed &quot;compassion and solidarity&quot; with the victims, saying on Twitter that the accident has &quot;plunged&quot; his nation into &quot;deep sadness.&quot;</p><p>Spain's King Felipe, who was in Paris at the time of the crash, said he was cutting short his trip to France.</p><p>Spainish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said all support will be given to families of those affected and that he was heading back to Madrid to chair an emergency meeting.

It said a team of technical advisers would be dispatched to assist the investigation into what brought the plane down, adding that the &quot;concerns and sympathy&quot; of Airbus employees goes to all those affected.</p><p></p><div class="stack-inline-video">

<p>Lucille Polizzi, an 18-year-old student who lives near Barcelonnette, described hearing a large noise that she initially thought was a military plane but later learned was most likely the doomed jet.</p><p>&quot;I was a bit surprised by the sound,&quot; she told NBC News. &quot;Some military planes train up here so we are used to some big noises, but this one sounded different.&quot;</p><p>Germanwings had to cancel seven flights after shaken crew members said they were unfit to fly. Spohr said that's understandable, as many crews knew crew members on the crashed plane. &quot;It is now more important to ensure psychological assistance if needed,&quot; he said.</p><p>Tuesday's accident was the first large passenger-jet crash on French soil since the 2000 Concorde disaster, but not the first aviation tragedy to strike near the town of Barcelonette. In 1953, an Air France crash there killed 49 people.</p><p></p><div class="stack-inline-video">
