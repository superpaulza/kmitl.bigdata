Metropolitan France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean; due to its shape, it is often referred to in French as <i>l’Hexagone<\/i> (\"The Hexagon\"). France is one of only three countries (with Morocco and Spain) to have both Atlantic and Mediterranean coastlines.<\/p>\n<p>By area, France is the 42nd largest country in the world but the largest country in Western Europe and the European Union (EU), and the third-largest in Europe as a whole. With a population approaching 67 million, it is the 20th most populated country and the second-most populated country in the EU. France is a semi-presidential republic with its capital in Paris, the nation's largest city and the main cultural and commercial center. The current Constitution of France, adopted by referendum on 4 October 1958, establishes the country as secular and democratic, with its sovereignty derived from the people. The nation's ideals are expressed in the <i>Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen<\/i>, one of the world's earliest documents on human rights, which was formulated during the seminal French Revolution of the late 18th century.<\/p>\n<p>France has been a major power in Europe since the Late Middle Ages, reaching the height of global prominence during the 19th and early 20th centuries, when it possessed the second-largest colonial empire in the world. Throughout its long history, France has produced many influential artists, thinkers, and scientists, and remains a prominent global center of culture. It hosts the world's fourth-largest number of cultural UNESCO World Heritage Sites and receives around 83 million foreign tourists annually – the most of any country in the world.<\/p>\n<p>France remains a great power with significant cultural, economic, military, and political influence in Europe and around the world. It has the world's fifth-largest military budget, third-largest stockpile of nuclear weapons, and second-largest diplomatic corps. Due to its overseas regions and territories throughout the world, France has the second-largest exclusive economic zone in the world. France is a developed country and has the world's fifth-largest economy by nominal GDP and seventh-largest by purchasing power parity. In terms of total household wealth, France is the wealthiest nation in Europe and fourth in the world.<\/p>\n<p>French citizens enjoy a high standard of living, and the country performs well in international rankings of education, health care, life expectancy, civil liberties, and human development. France is a founding member of the United Nations, where it serves as one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council. It is a member of numerous international institutions, including the Group of 7, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the World Trade Organization (WTO), and La Francophonie. France is a founding and leading member state of the EU.<\/p>","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=244","active":true,"facebookchat":"","slug":"france","placetype":"Country","geohash":"u031xp7js9x6","trend_rank_last":66,"local_url":"\/topic\/france\/","longitude":1.71819,"name":"France","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/France\">Wikipedia<\/a>","latitude":46.7107,"created_on":"2011-05-16T22:37:58","latest_item_date":"2015-03-24T09:18:52.923284","id":244,"kind":"location","image_height":600,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/c\/c3\/Flag_of_France.svg","daily_count":1,"recent_count":1,"woeid":23424819,"links":"","livevideo":"","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=244","muted_by_default":false,"wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/France","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/244\/","twitter_username":null,"trend_rank_current":66,"category":"Country"},{"item_count":192,"image_width":4368,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/charlie-hebdo\/","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/EbX","description":"<p><i><b>Charlie Hebdo<\/b><\/i> (<small>French pronunciation: ​<\/small>[ʃaʁli ɛbdo]; French for <i>Charlie Weekly<\/i>) is a French satirical weekly newspaper, featuring cartoons, reports, polemics and jokes.

His father is from Cameroon and his mother is French. Some of his performances and associations have been controversial and he has been convicted for antisemitism.<\/p>\n<p>Dieudonné initially achieved success with a Jewish comedian, Élie Semoun, humorously exploiting racial stereotypes. He campaigned against racism and was a candidate in the 1997 and 2001 legislative elections in Dreux against the National Front, the French far-right political party that he perceived as racist. On 1 December 2003, Dieudonné performed a sketch on a TV show about an Israeli settler whom he depicted as a Nazi. Some critics argued that he had \"crossed the limits of antisemitism\" and several organizations sued him for incitement to racial hatred. Dieudonné refused to apologize and denounced Zionism and the Jewish lobby.<\/p>\n<p>Dieudonné approached Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of the National Front political party that he had fought earlier, and the men became political allies and friends. Holocaust denial Robert Faurisson appeared in one of his shows in 2008. Dieudonné described Holocaust remembrance as \"memorial pornography\". Dieudonné was convicted in court eight times on antisemitism charges. Dieudonné subsequently found himself with increasing frequency banned from mainstream media, and many of his shows were cancelled by local authorities. Active on the internet and in his Paris theater, Dieudonné has continued to have a following.

Common definitions of terrorism refer only to those violent acts that are intended to create fear (terror); are perpetrated for a religious, political, or ideological goal; and deliberately target or disregard the safety of non-combatants (e.g., neutral military personnel or civilians). Some definitions now include acts of unlawful violence and war. The use of similar tactics by criminal organizations for protection rackets or to enforce a code of silence is usually not labeled terrorism, though these same actions may be labeled terrorism when done by a politically motivated group. Usage of the term has also been criticized for its frequent undue equating with <i>Islamism<\/i> or <i>jihadism<\/i>, while ignoring non-Islamic organizations or individuals.<\/p>\r\n<p>The word \"terrorism\" is politically loaded and emotionally charged, and this greatly compounds the difficulty of providing a precise definition. Studies have found over 100 definitions of \"terrorism\". In some cases, the same group may be described as \"freedom fighters\" by its supporters and considered to be terrorists by its opponents. The concept of terrorism may be controversial as it is often used by state authorities (and individuals with access to state support) to delegitimize political or other opponents, and potentially legitimize the state's own use of armed force against opponents (such use of force may be described as \"terror\" by opponents of the state). At the same time, the reverse may also take place when states perpetrate or are accused of perpetrating state terrorism. The usage of the term has a controversial history, with individuals such as ANC leader Nelson Mandela at one point also branded a terrorist.<\/p>\r\n<p>Terrorism has been practiced by a broad array of political organizations to further their objectives. It has been practiced by both right-wing and left-wing political parties, nationalistic groups, religious groups, revolutionaries, and ruling governments. An abiding characteristic is the indiscriminate use of violence against non-combatants for the purpose of gaining publicity for a group, cause, or individual. The symbolism of terrorism can exploit human fear to help achieve these goals.<\/p>","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=710","active":true,"facebookchat":"","slug":"terrorism","placetype":"","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":357,"local_url":"\/topic\/terrorism\/","longitude":null,"name":"terrorism","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Terrorism\">Wikipedia<\/a>","latitude":null,"created_on":"2011-05-16T17:28:30","latest_item_date":"2015-03-24T10:04:48.247402","id":710,"kind":"tag","image_height":925,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/8\/8a\/UA_Flight_175_hits_WTC_south_tower_9-11_edit.jpeg","daily_count":4,"recent_count":3,"woeid":null,"links":"","livevideo":"","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=710","muted_by_default":false,"wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Terrorism","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/710\/","twitter_username":null,"trend_rank_current":352,"category":"Topic"},{"item_count":54179,"image_width":1089,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/crime-courts\/","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/B","description":"<p>In ordinary language, the term <b>crime<\/b> denotes an unlawful act punishable by a state.

It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry which records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.<\/p>\n<p>The experience of being entertained has come to be strongly associated with amusement, so that one common understanding of the idea is fun and laughter, although many entertainments have a serious purpose. This may be the case in the various forms of ceremony, celebration, religious festival, or satire for example. Hence, there is the possibility that what appears as entertainment may also be a means of achieving insight or intellectual growth.<\/p>\n<p>An important aspect of entertainment is the audience, which turns a private recreation or leisure activity into entertainment. The audience may have a passive role, as in the case of persons watching a play, opera, television show, or film; or the audience role may be active, as in the case of games, where the participant\/audience roles may be routinely reversed. Entertainment can be public or private, involving formal, scripted performance, as in the case of theatre or concerts; or unscripted and spontaneous, as in the case of children's games. Most forms of entertainment have persisted over many centuries, evolving due to changes in culture, technology, and fashion. Films and video games, for example, although they use newer media, continue to tell stories, present drama, and play music. Festivals devoted to music, film, or dance allow audiences to be entertained over a number of consecutive days.<\/p>\n<p>Some activities that once were considered entertaining, particularly public punishments, have been removed from the public arena. Others, such as fencing or archery, once necessary skills for some, have become serious sports and even professions for the participants, at the same time developing into entertainment with wider appeal for bigger audiences. In the same way, other necessary skills, such as cooking, have developed into performances among professionals, staged as global competitions and then broadcast for entertainment. What is entertainment for one group or individual may be regarded as work by another.<\/p>\n<p>The familiar forms of entertainment have the capacity to cross over different media and have demonstrated a seemingly unlimited potential for creative remix. This has ensured the continuity and longevity of many themes, images, and structures.<\/p>","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=75","active":true,"facebookchat":"","slug":"entertainment","placetype":"","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":83,"local_url":"\/topic\/entertainment\/","longitude":null,"name":"entertainment","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Entertainment\">Wikipedia<\/a>","latitude":null,"created_on":"2012-10-23T22:22:14","latest_item_date":"2015-03-24T05:05:14.140587","id":75,"kind":"vertical","image_height":1024,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/f\/ff\/Match_on_TV.jpg","daily_count":11,"recent_count":0,"woeid":null,"links":"","livevideo":"","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=75","muted_by_default":false,"wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Entertainment","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/75\/","twitter_username":null,"trend_rank_current":83,"category":"Topic"}],"local_url":"\/item\/2015\/03\/18\/french-comedian-dieudonne-mbala-mbala-found-guil","shortened_url":"http:\/\/reut.rs\/1FBGoaC","updated_date":"2015-03-18T13:20:14.129106","url_domain":"reuters.com","push_content":"French comedian Dieudonne M'bala M'bala found guilty of condoning terrorism with anti-Charlie Hebdo Facebook post - @Reuters","type":"text","id":531787,"data_type":null,"media":null,"whoas":25,"content":"French comedian Dieudonne M'bala M'bala found guilty of condoning terrorism with anti-Charlie Hebdo Facebook post - @Reuters","importance":3,"date_ap":"Mar 18, 2015, 01:20 PM GMT","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/531787\/","source":null},{"author":{"id":8,"first_name":"Stephanie","username":"stephanie.clary","is_staff":true,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/8\/","full_name":"Stephanie Clary","email":"stephanie.clary@breakingnews.com","last_name":"Clary"},"tweet":null,"submitter":"editor","date":"2015-03-14T15:47:43.254546","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/CN1Q","data":null,"status":"published","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2015\/03\/14\/kosher-supermarket-in-eastern-paris-to-reopen-afte","slug":"kosher-supermarket-in-eastern-paris-to-reopen-afte","note":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.france24.com\/en\/20150314-kosher-supermarket-paris-hostage-reopen-coulibaly\/","pushed":true,"topics":[{"item_count":467,"image_width":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/shots-fired-at-french-satirical-magazine-charlie-hebdo\/","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/avi","description":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=102892","active":true,"facebookchat":"","slug":"shots-fired-at-french-satirical-magazine-charlie-hebdo","placetype":"","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":0,"local_url":"\/topic\/shots-fired-at-french-satirical-magazine-charlie-hebdo\/","longitude":null,"name":"Gunmen attack French magazine Charlie Hebdo","image_credit":"","latitude":null,"created_on":"2015-01-07T11:04:56.090160","latest_item_date":"2015-03-18T13:20:11.112811","id":102892,"kind":"arc","image_height":null,"image_url":"","daily_count":0,"recent_count":0,"woeid":null,"links":"","livevideo":"","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=102892","muted_by_default":false,"wikipedia_url":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/102892\/","twitter_username":null,"trend_rank_current":0,"category":"WarConflictEvent"},{"item_count":785,"image_width":1220,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/paris-ile-de-france-fr\/","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/IT","description":"<p><b>Paris<\/b> (<small>UK:<\/small> \/ˈpærɪs\/; <small>US:<\/small> \/ˈpɛərɪs\/; <small>French:<\/small> [paʁi]<small class=\"nowrap\"> ( )<\/small>) is the capital and most populous city of France.

Paris and its suburbs have a population of 12,292,895 inhabitants, making it the second or third largest metropolitan area in Europe, with London and Berlin, depending on the area measured.<\/p>\n<p>Paris was founded in the 3rd century BC by a Celtic people called the Parisii, who gave the city its name. By the 12th century, Paris was the largest city in the western world, a prosperous trading centre, and the home of the University of Paris, one of the first in Europe. In the 18th century, it was the centre stage for the French Revolution, and became an important centre of finance, commerce, fashion, science, and the arts, a position it still retains today.<\/p>\n<p>The Paris Region has a GDP of €612 billion (US$760 billion) in 2012, ranking it as one of the wealthiest five regions in Europe; it is the banking and financial centre of France, and contains the headquarters of thirty companies in the Fortune Global 500.

Common definitions of terrorism refer only to those violent acts that are intended to create fear (terror); are perpetrated for a religious, political, or ideological goal; and deliberately target or disregard the safety of non-combatants (e.g., neutral military personnel or civilians). Some definitions now include acts of unlawful violence and war. The use of similar tactics by criminal organizations for protection rackets or to enforce a code of silence is usually not labeled terrorism, though these same actions may be labeled terrorism when done by a politically motivated group. Usage of the term has also been criticized for its frequent undue equating with <i>Islamism<\/i> or <i>jihadism<\/i>, while ignoring non-Islamic organizations or individuals.<\/p>\r\n<p>The word \"terrorism\" is politically loaded and emotionally charged, and this greatly compounds the difficulty of providing a precise definition. Studies have found over 100 definitions of \"terrorism\". In some cases, the same group may be described as \"freedom fighters\" by its supporters and considered to be terrorists by its opponents. The concept of terrorism may be controversial as it is often used by state authorities (and individuals with access to state support) to delegitimize political or other opponents, and potentially legitimize the state's own use of armed force against opponents (such use of force may be described as \"terror\" by opponents of the state). At the same time, the reverse may also take place when states perpetrate or are accused of perpetrating state terrorism. The usage of the term has a controversial history, with individuals such as ANC leader Nelson Mandela at one point also branded a terrorist.<\/p>\r\n<p>Terrorism has been practiced by a broad array of political organizations to further their objectives. It has been practiced by both right-wing and left-wing political parties, nationalistic groups, religious groups, revolutionaries, and ruling governments. An abiding characteristic is the indiscriminate use of violence against non-combatants for the purpose of gaining publicity for a group, cause, or individual. The symbolism of terrorism can exploit human fear to help achieve these goals.<\/p>","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=710","active":true,"facebookchat":"","slug":"terrorism","placetype":"","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":357,"local_url":"\/topic\/terrorism\/","longitude":null,"name":"terrorism","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Terrorism\">Wikipedia<\/a>","latitude":null,"created_on":"2011-05-16T17:28:30","latest_item_date":"2015-03-24T10:04:48.247402","id":710,"kind":"tag","image_height":925,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/8\/8a\/UA_Flight_175_hits_WTC_south_tower_9-11_edit.jpeg","daily_count":4,"recent_count":3,"woeid":null,"links":"","livevideo":"","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=710","muted_by_default":false,"wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Terrorism","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/710\/","twitter_username":null,"trend_rank_current":352,"category":"Topic"},{"item_count":54179,"image_width":1089,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/crime-courts\/","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/B","description":"<p>In ordinary language, the term <b>crime<\/b> denotes an unlawful act punishable by a state. The term crime does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes.

One proposed definition is that a <b>crime<\/b>, also called an <b>offence<\/b> or a <b>criminal offence<\/b>, is an act harmful not only to some individual, but also to the community or the state (a public wrong). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\r\n<p>The idea that acts like murder, rape and theft are prohibited exists all around the world.

Born in Honolulu, Hawaii, Obama is a graduate of Columbia University and Harvard Law School, where he served as president of the <i>Harvard Law Review<\/i>. He was a community organizer in Chicago before earning his law degree. He worked as a civil rights attorney and taught constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School from 1992 to 2004. He served three terms representing the 13th District in the Illinois Senate from 1997 to 2004, running unsuccessfully for the United States House of Representatives in 2000.<\/p>\n<p>In 2004, Obama received national attention during his campaign to represent Illinois in the United States Senate with his victory in the March Democratic Party primary, his keynote address at the Democratic National Convention in July, and his election to the Senate in November. He began his presidential campaign in 2007 and, after a close primary campaign against Hillary Rodham Clinton in 2008, he won sufficient delegates in the Democratic Party primaries to receive the presidential nomination. He then defeated Republican nominee John McCain in the general election, and was inaugurated as president on January 20, 2009. Nine months after his election, Obama was named the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize laureate.<\/p>\n<p>During his first two years in office, Obama signed into law economic stimulus legislation in response to the Great Recession in the form of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010. Other major domestic initiatives in his first term included the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, often referred to as \"Obamacare\"; the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act; and the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010. In foreign policy, Obama ended U.S. military involvement in the Iraq War, increased U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan, signed the New START arms control treaty with Russia, ordered U.S. military involvement in Libya, and ordered the military operation that resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden. In November 2010, the Republicans regained control of the House of Representatives as the Democratic Party lost a total of 63 seats; and, after a lengthy debate over federal spending and whether or not to raise the nation's debt limit, Obama signed the Budget Control Act of 2011 and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012.<\/p>\n<p>Obama was re-elected president in November 2012, defeating Republican nominee Mitt Romney, and was sworn in for a second term on January 20, 2013. During his second term, Obama has promoted domestic policies related to gun control in response to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, and has called for full equality for LGBT Americans, while his administration has filed briefs which urged the Supreme Court to strike down the Defense of Marriage Act of 1996 and California's Proposition 8 as unconstitutional. In foreign policy, Obama ordered U.S. military involvement in Iraq in response to gains made by the Islamic State in Iraq after the 2011 withdrawal from Iraq, and has continued the process of ending U.S. combat operations in Afghanistan.<\/p>","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=5","active":true,"facebookchat":"","slug":"barack-obama","placetype":"","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":20,"local_url":"\/topic\/barack-obama\/","longitude":null,"name":"Barack Obama","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Barack_Obama\">Wikipedia<\/a>","latitude":null,"created_on":"2010-05-07T23:31:02","latest_item_date":"2015-03-24T00:02:07.921868","id":5,"kind":"tag","image_height":3356,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/8\/8d\/President_Barack_Obama.jpg","daily_count":10,"recent_count":0,"woeid":null,"links":"","livevideo":"","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=5","muted_by_default":false,"wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Barack_Obama","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/5\/","twitter_username":null,"trend_rank_current":20,"category":"Person"},{"item_count":121,"image_width":229,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/susan-rice\/","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/1V","description":"<p><b>Susan Elizabeth Rice<\/b> (born November 17, 1964) is the United States National Security Advisor.

The term crime does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law (i.e. something is a crime if applicable law says that it is). One proposed definition is that a <b>crime<\/b>, also called an <b>offence<\/b> or a <b>criminal offence<\/b>, is an act harmful not only to some individual, but also to the community or the state (a public wrong). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\r\n<p>The idea that acts like murder, rape and theft are prohibited exists all around the world. What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country. While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.<\/p>\r\n<p>The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime. Therefore, in modern societies, a criminal procedure must be adhered to during the investigation and trial. Only if found guilty, the offender may be sentenced to punishment such as community sentence, imprisonment, life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions, even death.<\/p>\r\n<p>To be classified as a crime, the act of doing something bad (actus reus) must be usually accompanied by the intention to do something bad (mens rea), with certain exceptions (strict liability).<\/p>\r\n<p>While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime. Breaches of private law (torts and breaches of contract) are not automatically punished by the state, but can be enforced through civil procedure.<\/p>","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=1","active":true,"facebookchat":"","slug":"crime-courts","placetype":"","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":1,"local_url":"\/topic\/crime-courts\/","longitude":null,"name":"crime & courts","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Crime\">Wikipedia<\/a>","latitude":null,"created_on":"2012-11-28T17:18:53","latest_item_date":"2015-03-24T10:31:51.240860","id":1,"kind":"vertical","image_height":900,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/4\/4b\/Pierre-Paul_Prud%27hon_-_Justice_and_Divine_Vengeance_Pursuing_Crime.JPG","daily_count":83,"recent_count":6,"woeid":null,"links":"","livevideo":"","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=1","muted_by_default":false,"wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Crime","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/1\/","twitter_username":null,"trend_rank_current":1,"category":"Topic"},{"item_count":52678,"image_width":802,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/politics\/","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/C","description":"<p><b>Politics<\/b> (from Greek: πολιτικός <i>politikos<\/i>, meaning \"of, for, or relating to citizens\") is the practice and theory of influencing other people on a global, civic or individual level.

Metropolitan France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean; due to its shape, it is often referred to in French as <i>l’Hexagone<\/i> (\"The Hexagon\"). France is one of only three countries (with Morocco and Spain) to have both Atlantic and Mediterranean coastlines.<\/p>\n<p>By area, France is the 42nd largest country in the world but the largest country in Western Europe and the European Union (EU), and the third-largest in Europe as a whole. With a population approaching 67 million, it is the 20th most populated country and the second-most populated country in the EU. France is a semi-presidential republic with its capital in Paris, the nation's largest city and the main cultural and commercial center. The current Constitution of France, adopted by referendum on 4 October 1958, establishes the country as secular and democratic, with its sovereignty derived from the people. The nation's ideals are expressed in the <i>Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen<\/i>, one of the world's earliest documents on human rights, which was formulated during the seminal French Revolution of the late 18th century.<\/p>\n<p>France has been a major power in Europe since the Late Middle Ages, reaching the height of global prominence during the 19th and early 20th centuries, when it possessed the second-largest colonial empire in the world. Throughout its long history, France has produced many influential artists, thinkers, and scientists, and remains a prominent global center of culture. It hosts the world's fourth-largest number of cultural UNESCO World Heritage Sites and receives around 83 million foreign tourists annually – the most of any country in the world.<\/p>\n<p>France remains a great power with significant cultural, economic, military, and political influence in Europe and around the world. It has the world's fifth-largest military budget, third-largest stockpile of nuclear weapons, and second-largest diplomatic corps. Due to its overseas regions and territories throughout the world, France has the second-largest exclusive economic zone in the world. France is a developed country and has the world's fifth-largest economy by nominal GDP and seventh-largest by purchasing power parity. In terms of total household wealth, France is the wealthiest nation in Europe and fourth in the world.<\/p>\n<p>French citizens enjoy a high standard of living, and the country performs well in international rankings of education, health care, life expectancy, civil liberties, and human development. France is a founding member of the United Nations, where it serves as one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council. It is a member of numerous international institutions, including the Group of 7, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the World Trade Organization (WTO), and La Francophonie.

Its name comes from a colloquialism for the directory given to students at some American universities. Facebook was founded on February 4, 2004, by Mark Zuckerberg with his college roommates and fellow Harvard University students Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes. The founders had initially limited the website's membership to Harvard students, but later expanded it to colleges in the Boston area, the Ivy League, and Stanford University. It gradually added support for students at various other universities and later to their high-school students. Facebook now allows anyone who claims to be at least 13 years old worldwide to become a registered user of the website, although proof is not required.<\/p>\n<p>After registering to use the site, users may create a personal profile, add other users as friends, exchange messages, post status updates and photos, and receive notifications when others update their profiles. Additionally, users may join common-interest user groups, organized by workplace, school or college, or other characteristics, and categorize their friends into lists such as \"People From Work\" or \"Close Friends\". Facebook had over one billion active users as of September 2012, of which approximately 9% were fake. By that point, Facebook was adding about half a petabyte of data every 24 hours, amounting to about 180 petabytes per year. Due to the large volume of data collected about users, the service's privacy policies have faced scrutiny, among other criticisms. Facebook, Inc. held its initial public offering in February 2012 and began selling stock to the public three months later, reaching a peak market capitalization of $104 billion.<\/p>","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=1066","active":true,"facebookchat":"","slug":"facebook","placetype":"","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":0,"local_url":"\/topic\/facebook\/","longitude":null,"name":"Facebook","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Facebook\">Wikipedia<\/a>","latitude":null,"created_on":"2010-05-12T21:51:00","latest_item_date":"2015-03-23T16:24:04.136849","id":1066,"kind":"tag","image_height":256,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/a\/ac\/Facebook_%28login%2C_signup_page%29.jpg","daily_count":1,"recent_count":0,"woeid":null,"links":"","livevideo":"","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=1066","muted_by_default":false,"wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Facebook","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/1066\/","twitter_username":null,"trend_rank_current":0,"category":"Company"},{"item_count":892,"image_width":3264,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/google\/","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/o","description":"<p><b>Google<\/b> \/ɡuːɡ(ə)l\/ is an American multinational corporation specializing in Internet-related services and products.

Together they own about 14 percent of its shares but control 56 of the stockholder voting power through supervoting stock. They incorporated Google as a privately held company on September 4, 1998. An initial public offering followed on August 19, 2004. Its mission statement from the outset was \"to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful,\" and its unofficial slogan was \"Don't be evil.\" In 2004, Google moved to headquarters in Mountain View, California, nicknamed the Googleplex.<\/p>\n<p>Rapid growth since incorporation has triggered a chain of products, acquisitions and partnerships beyond Google's core search engine. It offers online productivity software including email (Gmail), a cloud storage service (Google Drive), an office suite (Google Docs) and a social networking service (Google+). Desktop products include applications for web browsing, organizing and editing photos, and instant messaging. The company leads the development of the Android mobile operating system and the browser-only Chrome OS for a netbook known as a Chromebook. Google has moved increasingly into communications hardware: it partners with major electronics manufacturers in the production of its \"high-quality low-cost\" Nexus devices and acquired Motorola Mobility in May 2012. In 2012, a fiber-optic infrastructure was installed in Kansas City to facilitate a Google Fiber broadband service.<\/p>\n<p>The corporation has been estimated to run more than one million servers in data centers around the world (as of 2007) and to process over one billion search requests and about 24 petabytes of user-generated data each day (as of 2009).

Common definitions of terrorism refer only to those violent acts that are intended to create fear (terror); are perpetrated for a religious, political, or ideological goal; and deliberately target or disregard the safety of non-combatants (e.g., neutral military personnel or civilians). Some definitions now include acts of unlawful violence and war. The use of similar tactics by criminal organizations for protection rackets or to enforce a code of silence is usually not labeled terrorism, though these same actions may be labeled terrorism when done by a politically motivated group. Usage of the term has also been criticized for its frequent undue equating with <i>Islamism<\/i> or <i>jihadism<\/i>, while ignoring non-Islamic organizations or individuals.<\/p>\r\n<p>The word \"terrorism\" is politically loaded and emotionally charged, and this greatly compounds the difficulty of providing a precise definition. Studies have found over 100 definitions of \"terrorism\". In some cases, the same group may be described as \"freedom fighters\" by its supporters and considered to be terrorists by its opponents. The concept of terrorism may be controversial as it is often used by state authorities (and individuals with access to state support) to delegitimize political or other opponents, and potentially legitimize the state's own use of armed force against opponents (such use of force may be described as \"terror\" by opponents of the state). At the same time, the reverse may also take place when states perpetrate or are accused of perpetrating state terrorism. The usage of the term has a controversial history, with individuals such as ANC leader Nelson Mandela at one point also branded a terrorist.<\/p>\r\n<p>Terrorism has been practiced by a broad array of political organizations to further their objectives. It has been practiced by both right-wing and left-wing political parties, nationalistic groups, religious groups, revolutionaries, and ruling governments. An abiding characteristic is the indiscriminate use of violence against non-combatants for the purpose of gaining publicity for a group, cause, or individual.

Engineering is the discipline that seeks to study and design new technologies. Technologies significantly affect human as well as other animal species' ability to control and adapt to their natural environments. The term can either be applied generally or to specific areas: examples include <i>construction technology<\/i>, <i>medical technology<\/i> and <i>information technology<\/i>.<\/p>\n<p>The human species' use of technology began with the conversion of natural resources into simple tools. The prehistoric discovery of how to control fire increased the available sources of food and the invention of the wheel helped humans in travelling in and controlling their environment. Recent technological developments, including the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet, have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale. However, not all technology has been used for peaceful purposes; the development of weapons of ever-increasing destructive power has progressed throughout history, from clubs to nuclear weapons.<\/p>\n<p>Technology has affected society and its surroundings in a number of ways. In many societies, technology has helped develop more advanced economies (including today's global economy) and has allowed the rise of a leisure class. Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products, known as pollution, and deplete natural resources, to the detriment of Earth's environment. Various implementations of technology influence the values of a society and new technology often raises new ethical questions. Examples include the rise of the notion of efficiency in terms of human productivity, a term originally applied only to machines, and the challenge of traditional norms.<\/p>\n<p>Philosophical debates have arisen over the present and future use of technology in society, with disagreements over whether technology improves the human condition or worsens it. Neo-Luddism, anarcho-primitivism, and similar movements criticise the pervasiveness of technology in the modern world, opining that it harms the environment and alienates people; proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and techno-progressivism view continued technological progress as beneficial to society and the human condition. Indeed, until recently, it was believed that the development of technology was restricted only to human beings, but recent scientific studies indicate that other primates and certain dolphin communities have developed simple tools and learned to pass their knowledge to other generations.<\/p>","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=25","active":true,"facebookchat":"","slug":"tech","placetype":"","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":37,"local_url":"\/topic\/tech\/","longitude":null,"name":"tech","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Technology\">Wikipedia<\/a>","latitude":null,"created_on":"2012-10-23T22:09:18","latest_item_date":"2015-03-24T05:22:47.413062","id":25,"kind":"vertical","image_height":3072,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/8\/88\/Astronaut-EVA.jpg","daily_count":16,"recent_count":0,"woeid":null,"links":"","livevideo":"","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=25","muted_by_default":false,"wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Technology","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/25\/","twitter_username":"breakingbytes","trend_rank_current":37,"category":"Topic"}],"local_url":"\/item\/2015\/02\/21\/france-asks-google-facebook-and-twitter-to-agree","shortened_url":"http:\/\/bit.ly\/1AeBRJc","updated_date":"2015-02-21T16:24:37.841108","url_domain":"aljazeera.com","push_content":"France asks Google, Facebook and Twitter to agree to immediately take down material upon request - @AJEnglish","type":"text","id":518273,"data_type":null,"media":null,"whoas":51,"content":"France asks Google, Facebook and Twitter to agree to immediately take down material upon request from French officials - @AJEnglish","importance":2,"date_ap":"Feb 21, 2015, 08:11 AM GMT","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/518273\/","source":null},{"author":{"id":23,"first_name":"Tricia","username":"tricia.mcdermott","is_staff":true,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/23\/","full_name":"Tricia McDermott","email":"Tricia.McDermott@nbcuni.com","last_name":"McDermott"},"tweet":null,"submitter":"editor","date":"2015-02-19T16:53:37.495640","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/CKi0","data":null,"status":"published","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2015\/02\/19\/denmark-announces-150-million-package-to-boost-po","slug":"denmark-announces-150-million-package-to-boost-po","note":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/2015\/02\/19\/us-denmark-shooting-idUSKBN0LN1NT20150219","pushed":true,"topics":[{"item_count":88,"image_width":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/copenhagen-shooting-feb-14-2015\/","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/BFPQ","description":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=258494","active":true,"facebookchat":"","slug":"copenhagen-shooting-feb-14-2015","placetype":"","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":0,"local_url":"\/topic\/copenhagen-shooting-feb-14-2015\/","longitude":null,"name":"Copenhagen shootings, Feb. 14-15, 2015","image_credit":"","latitude":null,"created_on":"2015-02-14T15:47:03.342130","latest_item_date":"2015-03-20T15:12:16.462093","id":258494,"kind":"arc","image_height":null,"image_url":"","daily_count":0,"recent_count":0,"woeid":null,"links":"","livevideo":"","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=258494","muted_by_default":false,"wikipedia_url":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/258494\/","twitter_username":null,"trend_rank_current":0,"category":"CrimeCourtsEvent"},{"item_count":467,"image_width":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/shots-fired-at-french-satirical-magazine-charlie-hebdo\/","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/avi","description":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=102892","active":true,"facebookchat":"","slug":"shots-fired-at-french-satirical-magazine-charlie-hebdo","placetype":"","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":0,"local_url":"\/topic\/shots-fired-at-french-satirical-magazine-charlie-hebdo\/","longitude":null,"name":"Gunmen attack French magazine Charlie Hebdo","image_credit":"","latitude":null,"created_on":"2015-01-07T11:04:56.090160","latest_item_date":"2015-03-18T13:20:11.112811","id":102892,"kind":"arc","image_height":null,"image_url":"","daily_count":0,"recent_count":0,"woeid":null,"links":"","livevideo":"","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=102892","muted_by_default":false,"wikipedia_url":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/102892\/","twitter_username":null,"trend_rank_current":0,"category":"WarConflictEvent"},{"item_count":131,"image_width":370,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/denmark\/","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/t7","description":"<p><b>Denmark<\/b> \/ˈdɛnmɑrk\/ (Danish: <i>Danmark<\/i>), is a Nordic country in Northern Europe, located southwest of Sweden and south of Norway, and bordered to the south by Germany.

The term crime does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law (i.e. something is a crime if applicable law says that it is). One proposed definition is that a <b>crime<\/b>, also called an <b>offence<\/b> or a <b>criminal offence<\/b>, is an act harmful not only to some individual, but also to the community or the state (a public wrong). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\r\n<p>The idea that acts like murder, rape and theft are prohibited exists all around the world. What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country. While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.<\/p>\r\n<p>The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime. Therefore, in modern societies, a criminal procedure must be adhered to during the investigation and trial. Only if found guilty, the offender may be sentenced to punishment such as community sentence, imprisonment, life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions, even death.<\/p>\r\n<p>To be classified as a crime, the act of doing something bad (actus reus) must be usually accompanied by the intention to do something bad (mens rea), with certain exceptions (strict liability).<\/p>\r\n<p>While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime. Breaches of private law (torts and breaches of contract) are not automatically punished by the state, but can be enforced through civil procedure.<\/p>","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=1","active":true,"facebookchat":"","slug":"crime-courts","placetype":"","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":1,"local_url":"\/topic\/crime-courts\/","longitude":null,"name":"crime & courts","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Crime\">Wikipedia<\/a>","latitude":null,"created_on":"2012-11-28T17:18:53","latest_item_date":"2015-03-24T10:31:51.240860","id":1,"kind":"vertical","image_height":900,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/4\/4b\/Pierre-Paul_Prud%27hon_-_Justice_and_Divine_Vengeance_Pursuing_Crime.JPG","daily_count":83,"recent_count":6,"woeid":null,"links":"","livevideo":"","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=1","muted_by_default":false,"wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Crime","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/1\/","twitter_username":null,"trend_rank_current":1,"category":"Topic"},{"item_count":52678,"image_width":802,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/politics\/","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/C","description":"<p><b>Politics<\/b> (from Greek: πολιτικός <i>politikos<\/i>, meaning \"of, for, or relating to citizens\") is the practice and theory of influencing other people on a global, civic or individual level.

Furthermore, politics is the study or practice of the distribution of power and resources within a given community (a hierarchically organized population) as well as the interrelationship(s) between communities. A variety of methods are employed in politics, which include promoting one's own political views among people, negotiation with other political subjects, making laws, and exercising force, including warfare against adversaries.

It is situated on the eastern coast of Zealand, 42 km (26 mi) northwest of Malmö, Sweden and 164 km (102 mi) northeast of Odense. The city stretches across parts of the island of Amager and also contains the enclave of Frederiksberg, a municipality in its own right.<\/p>\n<p>Founded as a Viking fishing village in the 10th century, Copenhagen became the capital of Denmark in the early 15th century. During the 17th century, under the reign of Christian IV, it developed into an important regional centre, consolidating its position as capital of Denmark and Norway with its institutions, defences and armed forces. After suffering from the effects of plague and fire in the 18th century, the city underwent a period of redevelopment. This included construction of the prestigious district of Frederiksstaden and founding of such cultural institutions as the Royal Theatre and the Royal Academy of Fine Arts. After further disasters in the early 19th century when Nelson attacked the Danish fleet and bombarded the city, rebuilding during the Danish Golden Age brought a Neoclassical look to Copenhagen's architecture. Later, following the Second World War, the Finger Plan fostered the development of housing and businesses along the five urban railway routes stretching out from the city centre.<\/p>\n<p>Since the turn of the millennium, Copenhagen has seen strong urban and cultural development, facilitated by investment in its institutions and infrastructure. The city is the cultural, economic and governmental centre of Denmark; it is one of the major financial centres of Northern Europe with the Copenhagen Stock Exchange. In 2012, Copenhagen was third in the ranking of the richest cities in the world in terms of gross earnings, dropping from first place in 2009. Since the completion of the Øresund Bridge, a road, railway and tunnel project, the metropolitan area of Copenhagen has become increasingly integrated with the Swedish province of Scania and its largest city, Malmö, known as the Øresund Region. With a number of bridges connecting the various districts, the cityscape is characterized by parks, promenades and waterfronts. Copenhagen's landmarks such as Tivoli Gardens, the Little Mermaid Statue, the Amalienborg and Christiansborg palaces, Rosenborg Castle, Frederik's Church, and many museums, restaurants and nightclubs are significant tourist attractions. In addition to recent developments in the city service sector and the pharmaceutical industry, there have been a number of initiatives in clean technology, supporting the city's goal to be carbon-neutral by 2025.<\/p>\n<p>Copenhagen has more than 94,000 students enrolled in its largest universities and institutions, including the University of Copenhagen, the Technical University of Denmark and Copenhagen Business School. The University of Copenhagen, founded in 1479, is the oldest university in Denmark, and has repeatedly been ranked as one of the best universities in Europe. Copenhagen is home to the FC København and Brøndby football clubs and the ice hockey teams Rødovre Mighty Bulls, Herlev Eagles and Hvidovre Ligahockey. The annual Copenhagen Marathon was established in 1980. Copenhagen is one of the most bicycle-friendly cities in the world. The Copenhagen Metro serves central Copenhagen together with the S-train network connecting the outlying boroughs. Serving roughly 2 million passengers a month, Copenhagen Airport, Kastrup, is the largest airport in the Nordic countries.<\/p>","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=7976","active":true,"facebookchat":"","slug":"copenhagen-hovedstaden-dk","placetype":"Town","geohash":"u3buwp8cbnxf","trend_rank_last":0,"local_url":"\/topic\/copenhagen-hovedstaden-dk\/","longitude":12.5521,"name":"Copenhagen, Hovedstaden, DK","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Copenhagen\">Wikipedia<\/a>","latitude":55.6745,"created_on":"2012-04-27T10:51:46","latest_item_date":"2015-03-20T15:12:16.462093","id":7976,"kind":"location","image_height":795,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/6\/68\/Copenhagen_Collage2.jpg","daily_count":0,"recent_count":0,"woeid":554890,"links":"","livevideo":"","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=7976","muted_by_default":false,"wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Copenhagen","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/7976\/","twitter_username":null,"trend_rank_current":0,"category":"Town"},{"item_count":131,"image_width":370,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/denmark\/","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/t7","description":"<p><b>Denmark<\/b> \/ˈdɛnmɑrk\/ (Danish: <i>Danmark<\/i>), is a Nordic country in Northern Europe, located southwest of Sweden and south of Norway, and bordered to the south by Germany.

Danish: <i>København<\/i> German: <i>Kopenhagen<\/i> [kʰøb̥m̩ˈhɑʊ̯ˀn] <small>( listen)<\/small>) is the capital and most populated city of Denmark, with an urban population of 1,246,611 and a metropolitan population of 1,990,036 (as of 1 July 2014). It is situated on the eastern coast of Zealand, 42 km (26 mi) northwest of Malmö, Sweden and 164 km (102 mi) northeast of Odense. The city stretches across parts of the island of Amager and also contains the enclave of Frederiksberg, a municipality in its own right.<\/p>\n<p>Founded as a Viking fishing village in the 10th century, Copenhagen became the capital of Denmark in the early 15th century. During the 17th century, under the reign of Christian IV, it developed into an important regional centre, consolidating its position as capital of Denmark and Norway with its institutions, defences and armed forces. After suffering from the effects of plague and fire in the 18th century, the city underwent a period of redevelopment. This included construction of the prestigious district of Frederiksstaden and founding of such cultural institutions as the Royal Theatre and the Royal Academy of Fine Arts. After further disasters in the early 19th century when Nelson attacked the Danish fleet and bombarded the city, rebuilding during the Danish Golden Age brought a Neoclassical look to Copenhagen's architecture. Later, following the Second World War, the Finger Plan fostered the development of housing and businesses along the five urban railway routes stretching out from the city centre.<\/p>\n<p>Since the turn of the millennium, Copenhagen has seen strong urban and cultural development, facilitated by investment in its institutions and infrastructure. The city is the cultural, economic and governmental centre of Denmark; it is one of the major financial centres of Northern Europe with the Copenhagen Stock Exchange. In 2012, Copenhagen was third in the ranking of the richest cities in the world in terms of gross earnings, dropping from first place in 2009. Since the completion of the Øresund Bridge, a road, railway and tunnel project, the metropolitan area of Copenhagen has become increasingly integrated with the Swedish province of Scania and its largest city, Malmö, known as the Øresund Region. With a number of bridges connecting the various districts, the cityscape is characterized by parks, promenades and waterfronts. Copenhagen's landmarks such as Tivoli Gardens, the Little Mermaid Statue, the Amalienborg and Christiansborg palaces, Rosenborg Castle, Frederik's Church, and many museums, restaurants and nightclubs are significant tourist attractions. In addition to recent developments in the city service sector and the pharmaceutical industry, there have been a number of initiatives in clean technology, supporting the city's goal to be carbon-neutral by 2025.<\/p>\n<p>Copenhagen has more than 94,000 students enrolled in its largest universities and institutions, including the University of Copenhagen, the Technical University of Denmark and Copenhagen Business School. The University of Copenhagen, founded in 1479, is the oldest university in Denmark, and has repeatedly been ranked as one of the best universities in Europe. Copenhagen is home to the FC København and Brøndby football clubs and the ice hockey teams Rødovre Mighty Bulls, Herlev Eagles and Hvidovre Ligahockey. The annual Copenhagen Marathon was established in 1980. Copenhagen is one of the most bicycle-friendly cities in the world. The Copenhagen Metro serves central Copenhagen together with the S-train network connecting the outlying boroughs. Serving roughly 2 million passengers a month, Copenhagen Airport, Kastrup, is the largest airport in the Nordic countries.<\/p>","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=7976","active":true,"facebookchat":"","slug":"copenhagen-hovedstaden-dk","placetype":"Town","geohash":"u3buwp8cbnxf","trend_rank_last":0,"local_url":"\/topic\/copenhagen-hovedstaden-dk\/","longitude":12.5521,"name":"Copenhagen, Hovedstaden, DK","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Copenhagen\">Wikipedia<\/a>","latitude":55.6745,"created_on":"2012-04-27T10:51:46","latest_item_date":"2015-03-20T15:12:16.462093","id":7976,"kind":"location","image_height":795,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/6\/68\/Copenhagen_Collage2.jpg","daily_count":0,"recent_count":0,"woeid":554890,"links":"","livevideo":"","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=7976","muted_by_default":false,"wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Copenhagen","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/7976\/","twitter_username":null,"trend_rank_current":0,"category":"Town"},{"item_count":2918,"image_width":900,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/france\/","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/D6","description":"<p><b>France<\/b> (<small>UK:<\/small> \/frɑːns\/; <small>US:<\/small> \/fræns\/; <small>French:<\/small> [fʁɑ̃s]<small class=\"nowrap\"> ( )<\/small>), officially the <b>French Republic<\/b> (<small>French:<\/small> République française [ʁepyblik fʁɑ̃sɛz]), is a unitary sovereign state comprising territory in Western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. Metropolitan France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean; due to its shape, it is often referred to in French as <i>l’Hexagone<\/i> (\"The Hexagon\"). France is one of only three countries (with Morocco and Spain) to have both Atlantic and Mediterranean coastlines.<\/p>\n<p>By area, France is the 42nd largest country in the world but the largest country in Western Europe and the European Union (EU), and the third-largest in Europe as a whole. With a population approaching 67 million, it is the 20th most populated country and the second-most populated country in the EU. France is a semi-presidential republic with its capital in Paris, the nation's largest city and the main cultural and commercial center. The current Constitution of France, adopted by referendum on 4 October 1958, establishes the country as secular and democratic, with its sovereignty derived from the people. The nation's ideals are expressed in the <i>Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen<\/i>, one of the world's earliest documents on human rights, which was formulated during the seminal French Revolution of the late 18th century.<\/p>\n<p>France has been a major power in Europe since the Late Middle Ages, reaching the height of global prominence during the 19th and early 20th centuries, when it possessed the second-largest colonial empire in the world. Throughout its long history, France has produced many influential artists, thinkers, and scientists, and remains a prominent global center of culture. It hosts the world's fourth-largest number of cultural UNESCO World Heritage Sites and receives around 83 million foreign tourists annually – the most of any country in the world.<\/p>\n<p>France remains a great power with significant cultural, economic, military, and political influence in Europe and around the world. It has the world's fifth-largest military budget, third-largest stockpile of nuclear weapons, and second-largest diplomatic corps. Due to its overseas regions and territories throughout the world, France has the second-largest exclusive economic zone in the world. France is a developed country and has the world's fifth-largest economy by nominal GDP and seventh-largest by purchasing power parity. In terms of total household wealth, France is the wealthiest nation in Europe and fourth in the world.<\/p>\n<p>French citizens enjoy a high standard of living, and the country performs well in international rankings of education, health care, life expectancy, civil liberties, and human development. France is a founding member of the United Nations, where it serves as one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council. It is a member of numerous international institutions, including the Group of 7, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the World Trade Organization (WTO), and La Francophonie.

The Department of Homeland Security, and not the United States Department of the Interior, is equivalent to the Interior ministries of other countries. In fiscal year 2011, DHS was allocated a budget of $98.8 billion and spent, net, $66.4 billion.<\/p>\r\n<p>Where the Department of Defense is charged with military actions abroad, the Department of Homeland Security works in the civilian sphere to protect the United States within, at, and outside its borders. Its stated goal is to prepare for, prevent, and respond to domestic emergencies, particularly terrorism. On March 1, 2003, DHS absorbed the Immigration and Naturalization Service and assumed its duties. In doing so, it divided the enforcement and services functions into two separate and new agencies: Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Citizenship and Immigration Services. The investigative divisions and intelligence gathering units of the INS and Customs Service were merged forming Homeland Security Investigations. Additionally, the border enforcement functions of the INS, including the U.S. Border Patrol, the U.S. Customs Service, and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service were consolidated into a new agency under DHS: U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The Federal Protective Service falls under the National Protection and Programs Directorate.<\/p>\r\n<p>With more than 200,000 employees, DHS is the third largest Cabinet department, after the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs. Homeland security policy is coordinated at the White House by the Homeland Security Council. Other agencies with significant homeland security responsibilities include the Departments of Health and Human Services, Justice, and Energy.<\/p>\r\n<p>On December 16, 2013, the U.S. Senate confirmed Jeh Johnson as the Secretary of Homeland Security.<\/p>\r\n<p>According to the Homeland Security Research Corporation, the combined financial year 2010 state and local homeland security (HLS) markets, which employ more than 2.2 million first responders, totaled $16.5 billion, whereas the DHS HLS market totaled $13 billion. According to <i>The Washington Post<\/i>, \"DHS has given $31 billion in grants since 2003 to state and local governments for homeland security and to improve their ability to find and protect against terrorists, including $3.8 billion in 2010\".<\/p>\r\n<p>According to Peter Andreas, a border theorist, the creation of DHS constituted the most significant government reorganization since the Cold War, and the most substantial reorganization of federal agencies since the National Security Act of 1947, which placed the different military departments under a secretary of defense and created the National Security Council and Central Intelligence Agency. DHS also constitutes the most diverse merger of federal functions and responsibilities, incorporating 22 government agencies into a single organization.<\/p>","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=1396","active":true,"facebookchat":"","slug":"united-states-department-of-homeland-security","placetype":"","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":76,"local_url":"\/topic\/united-states-department-of-homeland-security\/","longitude":null,"name":"United States Department of Homeland Security","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security\">Wikipedia<\/a>","latitude":null,"created_on":"2011-07-20T22:07:06","latest_item_date":"2015-03-04T19:52:32.587682","id":1396,"kind":"tag","primary":true,"image_height":359,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/8\/8a\/Seal_of_the_United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security.svg","daily_count":0,"recent_count":0,"woeid":null,"links":"","livevideo":"","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=1396","muted_by_default":false,"wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/1396\/","twitter_username":null,"trend_rank_current":76,"category":"Organization"},{"item_count":467,"image_width":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/shots-fired-at-french-satirical-magazine-charlie-hebdo\/","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/avi","description":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=102892","active":true,"facebookchat":"","slug":"shots-fired-at-french-satirical-magazine-charlie-hebdo","placetype":"","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":0,"local_url":"\/topic\/shots-fired-at-french-satirical-magazine-charlie-hebdo\/","longitude":null,"name":"Gunmen attack French magazine Charlie Hebdo","image_credit":"","latitude":null,"created_on":"2015-01-07T11:04:56.090160","latest_item_date":"2015-03-18T13:20:11.112811","id":102892,"kind":"arc","image_height":null,"image_url":"","daily_count":0,"recent_count":0,"woeid":null,"links":"","livevideo":"","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=102892","muted_by_default":false,"wikipedia_url":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/102892\/","twitter_username":null,"trend_rank_current":0,"category":"WarConflictEvent"},{"item_count":624,"image_width":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/us-senate-immigration-reform-deal\/","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/HL","description":"<p>In November 2014, President Obama unveiled executive action on U.S. immigration policy, which included offering emporary legal status to millions of illegal immigrants, along with an indefinite reprieve from deportation.

His father is from Cameroon and his mother is French. Some of his performances and associations have been controversial and he has been convicted for antisemitism.<\/p>\n<p>Dieudonné initially achieved success with a Jewish comedian, Élie Semoun, humorously exploiting racial stereotypes. He campaigned against racism and was a candidate in the 1997 and 2001 legislative elections in Dreux against the National Front, the French far-right political party that he perceived as racist. On 1 December 2003, Dieudonné performed a sketch on a TV show about an Israeli settler whom he depicted as a Nazi. Some critics argued that he had \"crossed the limits of antisemitism\" and several organizations sued him for incitement to racial hatred. Dieudonné refused to apologize and denounced Zionism and the Jewish lobby.<\/p>\n<p>Dieudonné approached Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of the National Front political party that he had fought earlier, and the men became political allies and friends. Holocaust denial Robert Faurisson appeared in one of his shows in 2008. Dieudonné described Holocaust remembrance as \"memorial pornography\". Dieudonné was convicted in court eight times on antisemitism charges. Dieudonné subsequently found himself with increasing frequency banned from mainstream media, and many of his shows were cancelled by local authorities. Active on the internet and in his Paris theater, Dieudonné has continued to have a following. His quenelle signature gesture became notorious in 2013, particularly after footballer Nicolas Anelka used the gesture during a match in December 2013.<\/p>\n<p>After Dieudonné was recorded during a performance mocking a Jewish journalist, suggesting it was a pity that he was not sent to the gas chambers, French Interior Minister Manuel Valls stated that Dieudonné was \"no longer a comedian\" but was rather an \"anti-Semite and racist\" and that he would seek to ban all Dieudonné's public gatherings as a public safety risk. The ban on his shows has been upheld by French courts.<\/p>","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=53187","active":true,"facebookchat":"","slug":"dieudonne-mbala-mbala","placetype":"","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":0,"local_url":"\/topic\/dieudonne-mbala-mbala\/","longitude":null,"name":"Dieudonne M'bala M'bala","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dieudonn%C3%A9_M%27bala_M%27bala\">Wikipedia<\/a>","latitude":null,"created_on":"2014-01-09T13:54:52.267963","latest_item_date":"2015-03-18T13:20:11.112811","id":53187,"kind":"tag","image_height":1085,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/0\/09\/Dieudo.jpg","daily_count":0,"recent_count":0,"woeid":null,"links":"","livevideo":"","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=53187","muted_by_default":false,"wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dieudonn%C3%A9_M%27bala_M%27bala","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/53187\/","twitter_username":null,"trend_rank_current":0,"category":"Person"},{"item_count":2539,"image_width":1063,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/terrorism\/","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Lc","description":"<p>In the international community, <b>terrorism<\/b> has no legally binding, criminal law definition. Common definitions of terrorism refer only to those violent acts that are intended to create fear (terror); are perpetrated for a religious, political, or ideological goal; and deliberately target or disregard the safety of non-combatants (e.g., neutral military personnel or civilians). Some definitions now include acts of unlawful violence and war. The use of similar tactics by criminal organizations for protection rackets or to enforce a code of silence is usually not labeled terrorism, though these same actions may be labeled terrorism when done by a politically motivated group. Usage of the term has also been criticized for its frequent undue equating with <i>Islamism<\/i> or <i>jihadism<\/i>, while ignoring non-Islamic organizations or individuals.<\/p>\r\n<p>The word \"terrorism\" is politically loaded and emotionally charged, and this greatly compounds the difficulty of providing a precise definition. Studies have found over 100 definitions of \"terrorism\". In some cases, the same group may be described as \"freedom fighters\" by its supporters and considered to be terrorists by its opponents. The concept of terrorism may be controversial as it is often used by state authorities (and individuals with access to state support) to delegitimize political or other opponents, and potentially legitimize the state's own use of armed force against opponents (such use of force may be described as \"terror\" by opponents of the state). At the same time, the reverse may also take place when states perpetrate or are accused of perpetrating state terrorism. The usage of the term has a controversial history, with individuals such as ANC leader Nelson Mandela at one point also branded a terrorist.<\/p>\r\n<p>Terrorism has been practiced by a broad array of political organizations to further their objectives. It has been practiced by both right-wing and left-wing political parties, nationalistic groups, religious groups, revolutionaries, and ruling governments. An abiding characteristic is the indiscriminate use of violence against non-combatants for the purpose of gaining publicity for a group, cause, or individual. The symbolism of terrorism can exploit human fear to help achieve these goals.<\/p>","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=710","active":true,"facebookchat":"","slug":"terrorism","placetype":"","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":357,"local_url":"\/topic\/terrorism\/","longitude":null,"name":"terrorism","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Terrorism\">Wikipedia<\/a>","latitude":null,"created_on":"2011-05-16T17:28:30","latest_item_date":"2015-03-24T10:04:48.247402","id":710,"kind":"tag","image_height":925,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/8\/8a\/UA_Flight_175_hits_WTC_south_tower_9-11_edit.jpeg","daily_count":4,"recent_count":3,"woeid":null,"links":"","livevideo":"","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=710","muted_by_default":false,"wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Terrorism","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/710\/","twitter_username":null,"trend_rank_current":352,"category":"Topic"},{"item_count":54179,"image_width":1089,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/crime-courts\/","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/B","description":"<p>In ordinary language, the term <b>crime<\/b> denotes an unlawful act punishable by a state. The term crime does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law (i.e. something is a crime if applicable law says that it is). One proposed definition is that a <b>crime<\/b>, also called an <b>offence<\/b> or a <b>criminal offence<\/b>, is an act harmful not only to some individual, but also to the community or the state (a public wrong). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\r\n<p>The idea that acts like murder, rape and theft are prohibited exists all around the world. What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country. While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.<\/p>\r\n<p>The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime. Therefore, in modern societies, a criminal procedure must be adhered to during the investigation and trial. Only if found guilty, the offender may be sentenced to punishment such as community sentence, imprisonment, life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions, even death.<\/p>\r\n<p>To be classified as a crime, the act of doing something bad (actus reus) must be usually accompanied by the intention to do something bad (mens rea), with certain exceptions (strict liability).<\/p>\r\n<p>While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime. Breaches of private law (torts and breaches of contract) are not automatically punished by the state, but can be enforced through civil procedure.<\/p>","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=1","active":true,"facebookchat":"","slug":"crime-courts","placetype":"","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":1,"local_url":"\/topic\/crime-courts\/","longitude":null,"name":"crime & courts","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Crime\">Wikipedia<\/a>","latitude":null,"created_on":"2012-11-28T17:18:53","latest_item_date":"2015-03-24T10:31:51.240860","id":1,"kind":"vertical","image_height":900,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/4\/4b\/Pierre-Paul_Prud%27hon_-_Justice_and_Divine_Vengeance_Pursuing_Crime.JPG","daily_count":83,"recent_count":6,"woeid":null,"links":"","livevideo":"","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=1","muted_by_default":false,"wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Crime","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/1\/","twitter_username":null,"trend_rank_current":1,"category":"Topic"}],"local_url":"\/item\/2015\/02\/04\/on-trial-facing-charges-of-condoning-terror-frenc","shortened_url":"http:\/\/f24.my\/1zKIrag","updated_date":"2015-02-04T17:45:35.114458","url_domain":"france24.com","push_content":"On trial facing charges of condoning terror, French comedian Dieudonne tells court he condemns Paris attacks 'without any restraint and without any ambiguity' - @FRANCE24","type":"text","id":509019,"data_type":null,"media":null,"whoas":22,"content":"On trial facing charges of condoning terror, French comedian Dieudonne tells court he condemns Paris attacks 'without any restraint and without any ambiguity' - @FRANCE24","importance":2,"date_ap":"Feb 04, 2015, 05:45 PM GMT","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/509019\/","source":null},{"author":{"id":26,"first_name":"Sean","username":"sean.anderson","is_staff":true,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/26\/","full_name":"Sean Anderson","email":"sean.anderson@nbcuni.com","last_name":"Anderson"},"tweet":null,"submitter":"editor","date":"2015-01-31T08:15:14.319540","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/CHxz","data":null,"status":"published","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2015\/01\/31\/next-issue-of-charlie-hebdo-delayed-indefinitely-a","slug":"next-issue-of-charlie-hebdo-delayed-indefinitely-a","note":null,"url":"","pushed":true,"topics":[{"item_count":467,"image_width":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/shots-fired-at-french-satirical-magazine-charlie-hebdo\/","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/avi","description":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=102892","active":true,"facebookchat":"","slug":"shots-fired-at-french-satirical-magazine-charlie-hebdo","placetype":"","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":0,"local_url":"\/topic\/shots-fired-at-french-satirical-magazine-charlie-hebdo\/","longitude":null,"name":"Gunmen attack French magazine Charlie Hebdo","image_credit":"","latitude":null,"created_on":"2015-01-07T11:04:56.090160","latest_item_date":"2015-03-18T13:20:11.112811","id":102892,"kind":"arc","image_height":null,"image_url":"","daily_count":0,"recent_count":0,"woeid":null,"links":"","livevideo":"","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=102892","muted_by_default":false,"wikipedia_url":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/102892\/","twitter_username":null,"trend_rank_current":0,"category":"WarConflictEvent"},{"item_count":192,"image_width":4368,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/charlie-hebdo\/","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/EbX","description":"<p><i><b>Charlie Hebdo<\/b><\/i> (<small>French pronunciation: ​<\/small>[ʃaʁli ɛbdo]; French for <i>Charlie Weekly<\/i>) is a French satirical weekly newspaper, featuring cartoons, reports, polemics and jokes.

Metropolitan France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean; due to its shape, it is often referred to in French as <i>l’Hexagone<\/i> (\"The Hexagon\"). France is one of only three countries (with Morocco and Spain) to have both Atlantic and Mediterranean coastlines.<\/p>\n<p>By area, France is the 42nd largest country in the world but the largest country in Western Europe and the European Union (EU), and the third-largest in Europe as a whole. With a population approaching 67 million, it is the 20th most populated country and the second-most populated country in the EU. France is a semi-presidential republic with its capital in Paris, the nation's largest city and the main cultural and commercial center. The current Constitution of France, adopted by referendum on 4 October 1958, establishes the country as secular and democratic, with its sovereignty derived from the people. The nation's ideals are expressed in the <i>Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen<\/i>, one of the world's earliest documents on human rights, which was formulated during the seminal French Revolution of the late 18th century.<\/p>\n<p>France has been a major power in Europe since the Late Middle Ages, reaching the height of global prominence during the 19th and early 20th centuries, when it possessed the second-largest colonial empire in the world. Throughout its long history, France has produced many influential artists, thinkers, and scientists, and remains a prominent global center of culture. It hosts the world's fourth-largest number of cultural UNESCO World Heritage Sites and receives around 83 million foreign tourists annually – the most of any country in the world.<\/p>\n<p>France remains a great power with significant cultural, economic, military, and political influence in Europe and around the world. It has the world's fifth-largest military budget, third-largest stockpile of nuclear weapons, and second-largest diplomatic corps. Due to its overseas regions and territories throughout the world, France has the second-largest exclusive economic zone in the world. France is a developed country and has the world's fifth-largest economy by nominal GDP and seventh-largest by purchasing power parity. In terms of total household wealth, France is the wealthiest nation in Europe and fourth in the world.<\/p>\n<p>French citizens enjoy a high standard of living, and the country performs well in international rankings of education, health care, life expectancy, civil liberties, and human development. France is a founding member of the United Nations, where it serves as one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council.

Its capital Damascus is among the oldest continuously-inhabited cities in the world. A country of fertile plains, high mountains, and deserts, it is home to diverse ethnic and religious groups, including the majority Arab population, Alawite, Druze, Sunni and Christian. Other ethnic groups includes; Armenians, Assyrians, Kurds, Yezidi and Turks. Sunni Arabs make up the largest population group in Syria.<\/p>\n<p>In English, the name \"Syria\" was formerly synonymous with the Levant (known in Arabic as <i>al-Sham<\/i>) while the modern state encompasses the sites of several ancient kingdoms and empires, including the Eblan civilization of the third millennium BC. In the Islamic era, Damascus was the seat of the Umayyad Caliphate and a provincial capital of the Mamluk Sultanate in Egypt.<\/p>\n<p>The modern Syrian state was established after World War I as a French mandate, and represented the largest Arab state to emerge from the formerly Ottoman-ruled Arab Levant. It gained independence in April 1946, as a parliamentary republic. The post-independence period was tumultuous, and a large number of military coups and coup attempts shook the country in the period 1949–1971. Between 1958-61, Syria entered a brief union with Egypt, which was terminated by a military coup. Syria was under Emergency Law from 1963 to 2011, effectively suspending most constitutional protections for citizens, and its system of government is considered to be non-democratic. Bashar al-Assad has been president since 2000 and was preceded by his father Hafez al-Assad, who was in office from 1970 to 2000.<\/p>\n<p>Syria is a member of one international organization other than the United Nations, the Non-Aligned Movement; it is currently suspended from the Arab League and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, and self-suspended from the Union for the Mediterranean. Since March 2011, Syria has been embroiled in civil war in the wake of uprisings (considered an extension of the Arab Spring, the mass movement of revolutions and protests in the Arab world) against Assad and the Ba'athist government. An alternative government was formed by the opposition umbrella group, the Syrian National Coalition, in March 2012. Representatives of this government were subsequently invited to take up Syria's seat at the Arab League.<\/p>","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=52","active":true,"facebookchat":"","slug":"syria","placetype":"Country","geohash":"sy5y09zdyv07","trend_rank_last":0,"local_url":"\/topic\/syria\/","longitude":39.056,"name":"Syria","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Syria\">Wikipedia<\/a>","latitude":34.8148,"created_on":"2010-06-18T19:03:20","latest_item_date":"2015-03-24T04:35:01.660665","id":52,"kind":"location","image_height":600,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/5\/53\/Flag_of_Syria.svg","daily_count":2,"recent_count":0,"woeid":23424956,"links":"","livevideo":"","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=52","muted_by_default":false,"wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Syria","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/52\/","twitter_username":null,"trend_rank_current":0,"category":"Country"},{"item_count":192,"image_width":4368,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/charlie-hebdo\/","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/EbX","description":"<p><i><b>Charlie Hebdo<\/b><\/i> (<small>French pronunciation: ​<\/small>[ʃaʁli ɛbdo]; French for <i>Charlie Weekly<\/i>) is a French satirical weekly newspaper, featuring cartoons, reports, polemics and jokes.

Common definitions of terrorism refer only to those violent acts that are intended to create fear (terror); are perpetrated for a religious, political, or ideological goal; and deliberately target or disregard the safety of non-combatants (e.g., neutral military personnel or civilians). Some definitions now include acts of unlawful violence and war. The use of similar tactics by criminal organizations for protection rackets or to enforce a code of silence is usually not labeled terrorism, though these same actions may be labeled terrorism when done by a politically motivated group. Usage of the term has also been criticized for its frequent undue equating with <i>Islamism<\/i> or <i>jihadism<\/i>, while ignoring non-Islamic organizations or individuals.<\/p>\r\n<p>The word \"terrorism\" is politically loaded and emotionally charged, and this greatly compounds the difficulty of providing a precise definition. Studies have found over 100 definitions of \"terrorism\". In some cases, the same group may be described as \"freedom fighters\" by its supporters and considered to be terrorists by its opponents. The concept of terrorism may be controversial as it is often used by state authorities (and individuals with access to state support) to delegitimize political or other opponents, and potentially legitimize the state's own use of armed force against opponents (such use of force may be described as \"terror\" by opponents of the state). At the same time, the reverse may also take place when states perpetrate or are accused of perpetrating state terrorism. The usage of the term has a controversial history, with individuals such as ANC leader Nelson Mandela at one point also branded a terrorist.<\/p>\r\n<p>Terrorism has been practiced by a broad array of political organizations to further their objectives. It has been practiced by both right-wing and left-wing political parties, nationalistic groups, religious groups, revolutionaries, and ruling governments. An abiding characteristic is the indiscriminate use of violence against non-combatants for the purpose of gaining publicity for a group, cause, or individual. The symbolism of terrorism can exploit human fear to help achieve these goals.<\/p>","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=710","active":true,"facebookchat":"","slug":"terrorism","placetype":"","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":357,"local_url":"\/topic\/terrorism\/","longitude":null,"name":"terrorism","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Terrorism\">Wikipedia<\/a>","latitude":null,"created_on":"2011-05-16T17:28:30","latest_item_date":"2015-03-24T10:04:48.247402","id":710,"kind":"tag","image_height":925,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/8\/8a\/UA_Flight_175_hits_WTC_south_tower_9-11_edit.jpeg","daily_count":4,"recent_count":3,"woeid":null,"links":"","livevideo":"","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=710","muted_by_default":false,"wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Terrorism","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/710\/","twitter_username":null,"trend_rank_current":352,"category":"Topic"},{"item_count":54179,"image_width":1089,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/crime-courts\/","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/B","description":"<p>In ordinary language, the term <b>crime<\/b> denotes an unlawful act punishable by a state. The term crime does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law (i.e. something is a crime if applicable law says that it is). One proposed definition is that a <b>crime<\/b>, also called an <b>offence<\/b> or a <b>criminal offence<\/b>, is an act harmful not only to some individual, but also to the community or the state (a public wrong). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\r\n<p>The idea that acts like murder, rape and theft are prohibited exists all around the world. What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country. While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.<\/p>\r\n<p>The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime. Therefore, in modern societies, a criminal procedure must be adhered to during the investigation and trial. Only if found guilty, the offender may be sentenced to punishment such as community sentence, imprisonment, life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions, even death.<\/p>\r\n<p>To be classified as a crime, the act of doing something bad (actus reus) must be usually accompanied by the intention to do something bad (mens rea), with certain exceptions (strict liability).<\/p>\r\n<p>While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime.

It is generally characterised by extreme violence, social disruption and economic destruction. War should be understood as an actual, intentional and widespread armed conflict between political communities, and therefore is defined as a form of (collective) political violence or intervention. The set of techniques used by a group to carry out war is known as <b>warfare<\/b>. An absence of war is usually called peace.<\/p>\n<p>While some scholars see warfare as an inescapable and integral aspect of human nature, others argue that it is only inevitable under certain socio-cultural or ecological circumstances. For some the practice of war is not linked to any single type of political organization or society. Rather, as discussed by John Keegan in his <i>A History of Warfare<\/i>, war is a universal phenomenon whose form and scope is defined by the society that wages it. Another argument suggests that since there are human societies in which warfare does not exist, humans may not be naturally disposed for warfare, which emerges under particular circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>The deadliest war in history, in terms of the cumulative number of deaths since its start, is the Second World War, with 60–85 million deaths, followed by the Mongol conquests. Proportionally speaking, the most destructive war in modern history is the War of the Triple Alliance, which took the lives of over 60% of Paraguay's population, according to Steven Pinker. In 2003, Richard Smalley identified war as the sixth (of ten) biggest problems facing humanity for the next fifty years.<\/p>","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=15","active":true,"facebookchat":"","slug":"war-conflict","placetype":"","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":17,"local_url":"\/topic\/war-conflict\/","longitude":null,"name":"war & conflict","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/War\">Wikipedia<\/a>","latitude":null,"created_on":"2012-11-28T17:18:48","latest_item_date":"2015-03-24T10:28:54.851301","id":15,"kind":"vertical","image_height":768,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/a\/a7\/Cyprian_War.jpg","daily_count":30,"recent_count":5,"woeid":null,"links":"","livevideo":"","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=15","muted_by_default":false,"wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/War","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/15\/","twitter_username":null,"trend_rank_current":17,"category":"Topic"}],"local_url":"\/item\/2015\/01\/27\/french-police-arrest-5-in-raid-in-southern-town-of","shortened_url":"http:\/\/nyti.ms\/1ENcwWH","updated_date":"2015-01-27T09:57:48.846397","url_domain":"nytimes.com","push_content":"French police arrest 5 in raid in southern town of Lunel as part of counterterrorism effort after Charlie Hebdo attack - @nytimes","type":"text","id":504239,"data_type":null,"media":null,"whoas":18,"content":"French police arrest 5 in raid in southern town of Lunel as part of counterterrorism effort after Charlie Hebdo attack; detainees suspected of recruiting militants to fight in Syria - @nytimes","importance":3,"date_ap":"Jan 27, 2015, 09:57 AM GMT","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/504239\/","source":null},{"author":{"id":26,"first_name":"Sean","username":"sean.anderson","is_staff":true,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/26\/","full_name":"Sean Anderson","email":"sean.anderson@nbcuni.com","last_name":"Anderson"},"tweet":null,"submitter":"editor","date":"2015-01-23T13:15:14.449648","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/CGuM","data":null,"status":"published","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2015\/01\/23\/frances-constitutional-court-backs-move-to-strip","slug":"frances-constitutional-court-backs-move-to-strip","note":null,"url":"http:\/\/www.france24.com\/en\/20150123-court-backs-strip-jihadist-french-nationality-morocco-terrorism-conseil-constitutionnel\/","pushed":true,"topics":[{"item_count":467,"image_width":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/shots-fired-at-french-satirical-magazine-charlie-hebdo\/","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/avi","description":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=102892","active":true,"facebookchat":"","slug":"shots-fired-at-french-satirical-magazine-charlie-hebdo","placetype":"","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":0,"local_url":"\/topic\/shots-fired-at-french-satirical-magazine-charlie-hebdo\/","longitude":null,"name":"Gunmen attack French magazine Charlie Hebdo","image_credit":"","latitude":null,"created_on":"2015-01-07T11:04:56.090160","latest_item_date":"2015-03-18T13:20:11.112811","id":102892,"kind":"arc","image_height":null,"image_url":"","daily_count":0,"recent_count":0,"woeid":null,"links":"","livevideo":"","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=102892","muted_by_default":false,"wikipedia_url":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/102892\/","twitter_username":null,"trend_rank_current":0,"category":"WarConflictEvent"},{"item_count":2918,"image_width":900,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/france\/","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/D6","description":"<p><b>France<\/b> (<small>UK:<\/small> \/frɑːns\/; <small>US:<\/small> \/fræns\/; <small>French:<\/small> [fʁɑ̃s]<small class=\"nowrap\"> ( )<\/small>), officially the <b>French Republic<\/b> (<small>French:<\/small> République française [ʁepyblik fʁɑ̃sɛz]), is a unitary sovereign state comprising territory in Western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. Metropolitan France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean; due to its shape, it is often referred to in French as <i>l’Hexagone<\/i> (\"The Hexagon\").

France is a semi-presidential republic with its capital in Paris, the nation's largest city and the main cultural and commercial center. The current Constitution of France, adopted by referendum on 4 October 1958, establishes the country as secular and democratic, with its sovereignty derived from the people. The nation's ideals are expressed in the <i>Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen<\/i>, one of the world's earliest documents on human rights, which was formulated during the seminal French Revolution of the late 18th century.<\/p>\n<p>France has been a major power in Europe since the Late Middle Ages, reaching the height of global prominence during the 19th and early 20th centuries, when it possessed the second-largest colonial empire in the world. Throughout its long history, France has produced many influential artists, thinkers, and scientists, and remains a prominent global center of culture. It hosts the world's fourth-largest number of cultural UNESCO World Heritage Sites and receives around 83 million foreign tourists annually – the most of any country in the world.<\/p>\n<p>France remains a great power with significant cultural, economic, military, and political influence in Europe and around the world. It has the world's fifth-largest military budget, third-largest stockpile of nuclear weapons, and second-largest diplomatic corps. Due to its overseas regions and territories throughout the world, France has the second-largest exclusive economic zone in the world. France is a developed country and has the world's fifth-largest economy by nominal GDP and seventh-largest by purchasing power parity. In terms of total household wealth, France is the wealthiest nation in Europe and fourth in the world.<\/p>\n<p>French citizens enjoy a high standard of living, and the country performs well in international rankings of education, health care, life expectancy, civil liberties, and human development. France is a founding member of the United Nations, where it serves as one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council.

Geographically, Morocco is characterized by a rugged mountainous interior and large portions of desert. It is one of only three countries (with Spain and France) to have both Atlantic and Mediterranean coastlines. The Arabic name <i>al-Mamlakah al-Maghribiyah<\/i> (Arabic: المملكة المغربية‎, meaning \"The Western Kingdom\") and <i>Al-Maghrib<\/i> (Arabic: المغرب‎, meaning \"The West\") are commonly used as alternate names.<\/p>\n<p>Morocco has a population of over 33 million and an area of 446,550 km<sup>2<\/sup> (172,410 sq mi).

A historically prominent regional power, Morocco has a history of independence not shared by its neighbours. Its distinct culture is a blend of Arab, indigenous Berber, Sub-Saharan African, and European influences.<\/p>\n<p>Morocco claims the non-self-governing territory of Western Sahara as its Southern Provinces. Morocco annexed the territory in 1975, leading to a guerrilla war with indigenous forces until a cease-fire in 1991. Peace processes have thus far failed to break the political deadlock.<\/p>\n<p>Morocco is a constitutional monarchy with an elected parliament. The King of Morocco holds vast executive and legislative powers, especially over the military, foreign policy and religious affairs. Executive power is exercised by the government, while legislative power is vested in both the government and the two chambers of parliament, the Assembly of Representatives and the Assembly of Councillors.

Proportionally speaking, the most destructive war in modern history is the War of the Triple Alliance, which took the lives of over 60% of Paraguay's population, according to Steven Pinker. In 2003, Richard Smalley identified war as the sixth (of ten) biggest problems facing humanity for the next fifty years.<\/p>","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=15","active":true,"facebookchat":"","slug":"war-conflict","placetype":"","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":17,"local_url":"\/topic\/war-conflict\/","longitude":null,"name":"war & conflict","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/War\">Wikipedia<\/a>","latitude":null,"created_on":"2012-11-28T17:18:48","latest_item_date":"2015-03-24T10:28:54.851301","id":15,"kind":"vertical","image_height":768,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/a\/a7\/Cyprian_War.jpg","daily_count":30,"recent_count":5,"woeid":null,"links":"","livevideo":"","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=15","muted_by_default":false,"wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/War","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/15\/","twitter_username":null,"trend_rank_current":17,"category":"Topic"}],"local_url":"\/item\/2015\/01\/23\/paris-gunman-coulibaly-buried-in-paris-region-say","shortened_url":"","updated_date":"2015-01-23T17:14:15.102940","url_domain":null,"push_content":"Paris gunman Coulibaly buried in Paris region, say sources - @AFP","type":"text","id":502540,"data_type":null,"media":null,"whoas":17,"content":"Paris gunman Coulibaly buried in Paris region, say sources - @AFP","importance":3,"date_ap":"Jan 23, 2015, 10:21 AM GMT","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/502540\/","source":null},{"author":{"id":26,"first_name":"Sean","username":"sean.anderson","is_staff":true,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/26\/","full_name":"Sean Anderson","email":"sean.anderson@nbcuni.com","last_name":"Anderson"},"tweet":{"id":294858,"user_id":"99458922","content":"Afghans protest against French magazine in Kabul http:\/\/t.co\/n9EYQlHbPn http:\/\/t.co\/6nK9C70mZp","date":"2015-01-22T13:26:06","name":"Dunya TV","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/DunyaNews\/status\/558254278901374976","avatar":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/466090250209472512\/aqVqsgr0_normal.jpeg","location":"","screen_name":"DunyaNews","tweet_id":"558254278901374976","resource_uri":""},"submitter":"editor","date":"2015-01-23T10:01:17.608346","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/CGta","data":null,"status":"published","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2015\/01\/23\/photo-protests-in-afghanistan-against-charlie-heb","slug":"photo-protests-in-afghanistan-against-charlie-heb","note":null,"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/DunyaNews\/status\/558254278901374976","pushed":false,"topics":[{"item_count":711,"image_width":3881,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/kabul-kabul-af\/","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/vH","description":"<p><b>Kabul<\/b> (Pashto: کابل‎ \/ Persian: کابل)  also spelled <b>Kabol<\/b>, is the capital and largest city of Afghanistan.

Common definitions of terrorism refer only to those violent acts that are intended to create fear (terror); are perpetrated for a religious, political, or ideological goal; and deliberately target or disregard the safety of non-combatants (e.g., neutral military personnel or civilians). Some definitions now include acts of unlawful violence and war. The use of similar tactics by criminal organizations for protection rackets or to enforce a code of silence is usually not labeled terrorism, though these same actions may be labeled terrorism when done by a politically motivated group. Usage of the term has also been criticized for its frequent undue equating with <i>Islamism<\/i> or <i>jihadism<\/i>, while ignoring non-Islamic organizations or individuals.<\/p>\r\n<p>The word \"terrorism\" is politically loaded and emotionally charged, and this greatly compounds the difficulty of providing a precise definition. Studies have found over 100 definitions of \"terrorism\". In some cases, the same group may be described as \"freedom fighters\" by its supporters and considered to be terrorists by its opponents. The concept of terrorism may be controversial as it is often used by state authorities (and individuals with access to state support) to delegitimize political or other opponents, and potentially legitimize the state's own use of armed force against opponents (such use of force may be described as \"terror\" by opponents of the state). At the same time, the reverse may also take place when states perpetrate or are accused of perpetrating state terrorism. The usage of the term has a controversial history, with individuals such as ANC leader Nelson Mandela at one point also branded a terrorist.<\/p>\r\n<p>Terrorism has been practiced by a broad array of political organizations to further their objectives. It has been practiced by both right-wing and left-wing political parties, nationalistic groups, religious groups, revolutionaries, and ruling governments. An abiding characteristic is the indiscriminate use of violence against non-combatants for the purpose of gaining publicity for a group, cause, or individual. The symbolism of terrorism can exploit human fear to help achieve these goals.<\/p>","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=710","active":true,"facebookchat":"","slug":"terrorism","placetype":"","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":357,"local_url":"\/topic\/terrorism\/","longitude":null,"name":"terrorism","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Terrorism\">Wikipedia<\/a>","latitude":null,"created_on":"2011-05-16T17:28:30","latest_item_date":"2015-03-24T10:04:48.247402","id":710,"kind":"tag","image_height":925,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/8\/8a\/UA_Flight_175_hits_WTC_south_tower_9-11_edit.jpeg","daily_count":4,"recent_count":3,"woeid":null,"links":"","livevideo":"","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=710","muted_by_default":false,"wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Terrorism","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/710\/","twitter_username":null,"trend_rank_current":352,"category":"Topic"},{"item_count":54179,"image_width":1089,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/crime-courts\/","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/B","description":"<p>In ordinary language, the term <b>crime<\/b> denotes an unlawful act punishable by a state. The term crime does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law (i.e. something is a crime if applicable law says that it is). One proposed definition is that a <b>crime<\/b>, also called an <b>offence<\/b> or a <b>criminal offence<\/b>, is an act harmful not only to some individual, but also to the community or the state (a public wrong). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\r\n<p>The idea that acts like murder, rape and theft are prohibited exists all around the world. What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country. While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.<\/p>\r\n<p>The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime. Therefore, in modern societies, a criminal procedure must be adhered to during the investigation and trial. Only if found guilty, the offender may be sentenced to punishment such as community sentence, imprisonment, life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions, even death.<\/p>\r\n<p>To be classified as a crime, the act of doing something bad (actus reus) must be usually accompanied by the intention to do something bad (mens rea), with certain exceptions (strict liability).<\/p>\r\n<p>While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime. Breaches of private law (torts and breaches of contract) are not automatically punished by the state, but can be enforced through civil procedure.<\/p>","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=1","active":true,"facebookchat":"","slug":"crime-courts","placetype":"","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":1,"local_url":"\/topic\/crime-courts\/","longitude":null,"name":"crime & courts","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Crime\">Wikipedia<\/a>","latitude":null,"created_on":"2012-11-28T17:18:53","latest_item_date":"2015-03-24T10:31:51.240860","id":1,"kind":"vertical","image_height":900,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/4\/4b\/Pierre-Paul_Prud%27hon_-_Justice_and_Divine_Vengeance_Pursuing_Crime.JPG","daily_count":83,"recent_count":6,"woeid":null,"links":"","livevideo":"","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=1","muted_by_default":false,"wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Crime","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/1\/","twitter_username":null,"trend_rank_current":1,"category":"Topic"},{"item_count":29532,"image_width":589,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/war-conflict\/","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/P","description":"<p><b>War<\/b> is an organized and often prolonged conflict that is carried out by states or non-state actors. It is generally characterised by extreme violence, social disruption and economic destruction. War should be understood as an actual, intentional and widespread armed conflict between political communities, and therefore is defined as a form of (collective) political violence or intervention. The set of techniques used by a group to carry out war is known as <b>warfare<\/b>. An absence of war is usually called peace.<\/p>\n<p>While some scholars see warfare as an inescapable and integral aspect of human nature, others argue that it is only inevitable under certain socio-cultural or ecological circumstances. For some the practice of war is not linked to any single type of political organization or society. Rather, as discussed by John Keegan in his <i>A History of Warfare<\/i>, war is a universal phenomenon whose form and scope is defined by the society that wages it. Another argument suggests that since there are human societies in which warfare does not exist, humans may not be naturally disposed for warfare, which emerges under particular circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>The deadliest war in history, in terms of the cumulative number of deaths since its start, is the Second World War, with 60–85 million deaths, followed by the Mongol conquests. Proportionally speaking, the most destructive war in modern history is the War of the Triple Alliance, which took the lives of over 60% of Paraguay's population, according to Steven Pinker. In 2003, Richard Smalley identified war as the sixth (of ten) biggest problems facing humanity for the next fifty years.<\/p>","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=15","active":true,"facebookchat":"","slug":"war-conflict","placetype":"","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":17,"local_url":"\/topic\/war-conflict\/","longitude":null,"name":"war & conflict","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/War\">Wikipedia<\/a>","latitude":null,"created_on":"2012-11-28T17:18:48","latest_item_date":"2015-03-24T10:28:54.851301","id":15,"kind":"vertical","image_height":768,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/a\/a7\/Cyprian_War.jpg","daily_count":30,"recent_count":5,"woeid":null,"links":"","livevideo":"","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=15","muted_by_default":false,"wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/War","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/15\/","twitter_username":null,"trend_rank_current":17,"category":"Topic"}],"local_url":"\/item\/2015\/01\/21\/prosecutor-4-with-ties-to-kosher-market-gunman-ar","shortened_url":null,"updated_date":"2015-01-21T08:25:44.179277","url_domain":null,"push_content":"Prosecutor: 4 with ties to kosher market gunman are first charged in French terror attacks - @AP","type":"text","id":501231,"data_type":null,"media":null,"whoas":27,"content":"Prosecutor: 4 with ties to kosher market gunman are first charged in French terror attacks - @AP","importance":4,"date_ap":"Jan 21, 2015, 08:25 AM GMT","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/501231\/","source":null},{"author":{"id":8,"first_name":"Stephanie","username":"stephanie.clary","is_staff":true,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/8\/","full_name":"Stephanie Clary","email":"stephanie.clary@breakingnews.com","last_name":"Clary"},"tweet":null,"submitter":"editor","date":"2015-01-21T00:41:19.611881","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/CGVZ","data":null,"status":"published","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2015\/01\/21\/update-president-obama-and-french-president-holla","slug":"update-president-obama-and-french-president-holla","note":null,"url":"","pushed":true,"topics":[{"item_count":606,"image_width":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/nigeria-sect-attacks\/","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Ie","description":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=526","active":true,"facebookchat":"off","slug":"nigeria-sect-attacks","placetype":"","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":0,"local_url":"\/topic\/nigeria-sect-attacks\/","longitude":null,"name":"Boko Haram attacks","image_credit":"","latitude":null,"created_on":"2012-02-24T20:47:15","latest_item_date":"2015-03-22T17:40:16.842493","id":526,"kind":"arc","image_height":null,"image_url":"","daily_count":0,"recent_count":0,"woeid":null,"links":"","livevideo":"","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=526","muted_by_default":false,"wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nigeria_sect_attacks","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/526\/","twitter_username":null,"trend_rank_current":0,"category":"WarConflictEvent"},{"item_count":467,"image_width":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/shots-fired-at-french-satirical-magazine-charlie-hebdo\/","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/avi","description":"","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=102892","active":true,"facebookchat":"","slug":"shots-fired-at-french-satirical-magazine-charlie-hebdo","placetype":"","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":0,"local_url":"\/topic\/shots-fired-at-french-satirical-magazine-charlie-hebdo\/","longitude":null,"name":"Gunmen attack French magazine Charlie Hebdo","image_credit":"","latitude":null,"created_on":"2015-01-07T11:04:56.090160","latest_item_date":"2015-03-18T13:20:11.112811","id":102892,"kind":"arc","image_height":null,"image_url":"","daily_count":0,"recent_count":0,"woeid":null,"links":"","livevideo":"","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=102892","muted_by_default":false,"wikipedia_url":"","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/102892\/","twitter_username":null,"trend_rank_current":0,"category":"WarConflictEvent"},{"item_count":4204,"image_width":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/ukraine-protests-over-eu-agreement-delay\/","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/NCb","description":"<p>Ukraine's turmoil has become Europe's most severe security crisis in years and tensions have been high since Russian troops seized control of Crimea, which has now decided to merge with Russia.

Regarding religion, Nigeria is roughly divided in half between Christians, who live mostly in the southern and central parts of the country, and Muslims, concentrated mostly in the northern and southwestern regions. A minority of the population practice religions indigenous to Nigeria, such as those native to Igbo and Yoruba peoples.<\/p>\n<p>In 2014, Nigeria's economy (GDP) became the largest in Africa, worth more than $500 billion, and overtook South Africa to become the world's 26th largest economy.

The country's oil reserves have played a major role in its growing wealth and influence. Nigeria is considered to be an Emerging market by the World Bank and has been identified as a regional power in Africa. It is also a member of the MINT group of countries, which are widely seen as the globe's next \"BRIC-like\" economies.

It has an area of 603,628 km<sup>2<\/sup> (233,062 sq mi), making it the largest country entirely within Europe. Ukraine borders Russia to the east and northeast, Belarus to the northwest, Poland, Slovakia and Hungary to the west, Romania and Moldova to the southwest, and the Black Sea and Sea of Azov to the south and southeast, respectively. The territory of Ukraine has been inhabited for at least 44,000 years, and is the prime candidate site for the domestication of the horse and for the origins of the Indo-European language family.<\/p>\n<p>In the Middle Ages, the area became a key center of East Slavic culture, as epitomized by the powerful state of Kievan Rus'. Following its fragmentation in the 13th century, the territory of the present day Ukraine was contested, ruled and divided by a variety of powers, including Lithuania, Poland, Austro-Hungary, and Russia. A Cossack republic emerged and prospered during the 17th and 18th centuries, but Ukraine remained otherwise divided until its consolidation into a Soviet republic in the 20th century, becoming an independent state only in 1991.<\/p>\n<p>Ukraine has long been a global breadbasket because of its extensive, fertile farmlands. In 2011, it was the world's third-largest grain exporter with that year's harvest being much larger than average. Ukraine is one of the ten most attractive agricultural land acquisition regions. The country also has a well-developed manufacturing sector, particularly in aerospace and industrial equipment.<\/p>\n<p>Ukraine is a unitary republic under a semi-presidential system with separate powers: legislative, executive, and judicial branches. Its capital and largest city is Kiev. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Ukraine continues to maintain the second-largest military in Europe, after that of Russian Federation, when reserves and paramilitary personnel are taken into account. The country is home to 45.4 million people (including Crimea), 77.8% of whom are Ukrainians by ethnicity, and with a sizable minority of Russians (17%), as well as Romanians\/Moldovans, Belarusians, Crimean Tatars, and Hungarians. Ukrainian is the official language of Ukraine; its alphabet is Cyrillic. Russian is also still widely spoken. The dominant religion in the country is Eastern Orthodox Christianity, which has strongly influenced Ukrainian architecture, literature and music.<\/p>","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=492","active":true,"facebookchat":"","slug":"ukraine","placetype":"Country","geohash":"u8w5jrgfbf7b","trend_rank_last":34,"local_url":"\/topic\/ukraine\/","longitude":31.1734,"name":"Ukraine","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ukraine\">Wikipedia<\/a>","latitude":48.3829,"created_on":"2012-12-15T03:07:26","latest_item_date":"2015-03-24T09:02:49.330769","id":492,"kind":"location","image_height":800,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/4\/49\/Flag_of_Ukraine.svg","daily_count":5,"recent_count":1,"woeid":23424976,"links":"","livevideo":"","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=492","muted_by_default":false,"wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ukraine","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/492\/","twitter_username":null,"trend_rank_current":34,"category":"Country"},{"item_count":9338,"image_width":2687,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/barack-obama\/","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/F","description":"<p><b>Barack Hussein Obama II<\/b> (<small>US<\/small> \/bəˈrɑːk huːˈseɪn ɵˈbɑːmə\/, <small>UK<\/small> \/ˈbæræk huːˈseɪn ɵˈbɑːmə\/; born August 4, 1961) is the 44th and current President of the United States, and the first African American to hold the office. Born in Honolulu, Hawaii, Obama is a graduate of Columbia University and Harvard Law School, where he served as president of the <i>Harvard Law Review<\/i>. He was a community organizer in Chicago before earning his law degree. He worked as a civil rights attorney and taught constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School from 1992 to 2004. He served three terms representing the 13th District in the Illinois Senate from 1997 to 2004, running unsuccessfully for the United States House of Representatives in 2000.<\/p>\n<p>In 2004, Obama received national attention during his campaign to represent Illinois in the United States Senate with his victory in the March Democratic Party primary, his keynote address at the Democratic National Convention in July, and his election to the Senate in November. He began his presidential campaign in 2007 and, after a close primary campaign against Hillary Rodham Clinton in 2008, he won sufficient delegates in the Democratic Party primaries to receive the presidential nomination. He then defeated Republican nominee John McCain in the general election, and was inaugurated as president on January 20, 2009. Nine months after his election, Obama was named the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize laureate.<\/p>\n<p>During his first two years in office, Obama signed into law economic stimulus legislation in response to the Great Recession in the form of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010. Other major domestic initiatives in his first term included the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, often referred to as \"Obamacare\"; the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act; and the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010. In foreign policy, Obama ended U.S. military involvement in the Iraq War, increased U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan, signed the New START arms control treaty with Russia, ordered U.S. military involvement in Libya, and ordered the military operation that resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden. In November 2010, the Republicans regained control of the House of Representatives as the Democratic Party lost a total of 63 seats; and, after a lengthy debate over federal spending and whether or not to raise the nation's debt limit, Obama signed the Budget Control Act of 2011 and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012.<\/p>\n<p>Obama was re-elected president in November 2012, defeating Republican nominee Mitt Romney, and was sworn in for a second term on January 20, 2013. During his second term, Obama has promoted domestic policies related to gun control in response to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, and has called for full equality for LGBT Americans, while his administration has filed briefs which urged the Supreme Court to strike down the Defense of Marriage Act of 1996 and California's Proposition 8 as unconstitutional. In foreign policy, Obama ordered U.S. military involvement in Iraq in response to gains made by the Islamic State in Iraq after the 2011 withdrawal from Iraq, and has continued the process of ending U.S. combat operations in Afghanistan.<\/p>","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=5","active":true,"facebookchat":"","slug":"barack-obama","placetype":"","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":20,"local_url":"\/topic\/barack-obama\/","longitude":null,"name":"Barack Obama","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Barack_Obama\">Wikipedia<\/a>","latitude":null,"created_on":"2010-05-07T23:31:02","latest_item_date":"2015-03-24T00:02:07.921868","id":5,"kind":"tag","image_height":3356,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/8\/8d\/President_Barack_Obama.jpg","daily_count":10,"recent_count":0,"woeid":null,"links":"","livevideo":"","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=5","muted_by_default":false,"wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Barack_Obama","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/5\/","twitter_username":null,"trend_rank_current":20,"category":"Person"},{"item_count":3670,"image_width":4368,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/elections\/","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Cc","description":"<p>An <b>election<\/b> is a formal decision-making process by which a population chooses an individual to hold public office.

Rome is the capital of Italy and also of the Province of Rome and of the region of Lazio. With 2.9 million residents in 1,285.3 km<sup>2<\/sup> (496.3 sq mi), it is also the country's largest and most populated <i>comune<\/i> and fourth-most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. The urban area of Rome extends beyond the administrative city limits with a population of around 3.8 million. Between 3.2 and 4.2 million people live in Rome metropolitan area. The city is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of Tiber river. Vatican City is an independent country within the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city: for this reason Rome has been often defined as capital of two states.<\/p>\n<p>Rome's history spans more than two and a half thousand years, since its legendary founding in 753 BC. Rome is one of the oldest continuously occupied cities in Europe. It is referred to as \"The Eternal City\" (Latin: <i>Roma Aeterna<\/i>), a central notion in ancient Roman culture. In the ancient world it was successively the capital city of the Roman Kingdom, the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire, and is regarded as one of the birthplaces of Western civilization. Since the 1st century AD, Rome has been considered the seat of the Papacy and in the 8th century it became the capital of the Papal States, which lasted until 1870. In 1871 Rome became the capital of the Kingdom of Italy, and in 1946 that of the Italian Republic.<\/p>\n<p>After the Middle Ages, almost all the popes since Nicholas V (1422–55) pursued coherently along four hundred years an architectonic and urbanistic program aimed to make of the city the world`s artistic and cultural center. Due to that, Rome became first one of the major centers of the Italian Renaissance along with Florence, and then the birthplace of Baroque style. Famous artists and architects, such as - to name just a few - Bramante, Michelangelo, Raphael and Bernini, made of the city the center of their activity, creating masterpieces like St Peter's Basilica, the Sistine Chapel, Raphael Rooms and St. Peter's Square.<\/p>\n<p>Rome has the status of a global city. In 2011, Rome was the 18th-most-visited city in the world, 3rd most visited in the European Union, and the most popular tourist attraction in Italy. Its historic centre is listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. Monuments and museums such as the Vatican Museums and the Colosseum are among the world's most visited tourist destinations with both locations receiving millions of tourists a year. Rome hosted the 1960 Summer Olympics and is the seat of United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).<\/p>","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=2086","active":true,"facebookchat":"","slug":"rome-lazio-it","placetype":"Town","geohash":"sr2ykk5pjpzz","trend_rank_last":0,"local_url":"\/topic\/rome-lazio-it\/","longitude":12.4956,"name":"Rome, Lazio, IT","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rome\">Wikipedia<\/a>","latitude":41.8984,"created_on":"2010-06-09T19:26:04","latest_item_date":"2015-03-08T15:08:01.997882","id":2086,"kind":"location","image_height":4096,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/7\/75\/Collage_Rome.jpg","daily_count":0,"recent_count":0,"woeid":721943,"links":"","livevideo":"","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=2086","muted_by_default":false,"wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rome","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/2086\/","twitter_username":null,"trend_rank_current":0,"category":"Town"},{"item_count":2539,"image_width":1063,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/terrorism\/","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Lc","description":"<p>In the international community, <b>terrorism<\/b> has no legally binding, criminal law definition. Common definitions of terrorism refer only to those violent acts that are intended to create fear (terror); are perpetrated for a religious, political, or ideological goal; and deliberately target or disregard the safety of non-combatants (e.g., neutral military personnel or civilians). Some definitions now include acts of unlawful violence and war. The use of similar tactics by criminal organizations for protection rackets or to enforce a code of silence is usually not labeled terrorism, though these same actions may be labeled terrorism when done by a politically motivated group. Usage of the term has also been criticized for its frequent undue equating with <i>Islamism<\/i> or <i>jihadism<\/i>, while ignoring non-Islamic organizations or individuals.<\/p>\r\n<p>The word \"terrorism\" is politically loaded and emotionally charged, and this greatly compounds the difficulty of providing a precise definition. Studies have found over 100 definitions of \"terrorism\". In some cases, the same group may be described as \"freedom fighters\" by its supporters and considered to be terrorists by its opponents. The concept of terrorism may be controversial as it is often used by state authorities (and individuals with access to state support) to delegitimize political or other opponents, and potentially legitimize the state's own use of armed force against opponents (such use of force may be described as \"terror\" by opponents of the state). At the same time, the reverse may also take place when states perpetrate or are accused of perpetrating state terrorism. The usage of the term has a controversial history, with individuals such as ANC leader Nelson Mandela at one point also branded a terrorist.<\/p>\r\n<p>Terrorism has been practiced by a broad array of political organizations to further their objectives.

An abiding characteristic is the indiscriminate use of violence against non-combatants for the purpose of gaining publicity for a group, cause, or individual.

Metropolitan France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean; due to its shape, it is often referred to in French as <i>l’Hexagone<\/i> (\"The Hexagon\"). France is one of only three countries (with Morocco and Spain) to have both Atlantic and Mediterranean coastlines.<\/p>\n<p>By area, France is the 42nd largest country in the world but the largest country in Western Europe and the European Union (EU), and the third-largest in Europe as a whole. With a population approaching 67 million, it is the 20th most populated country and the second-most populated country in the EU. France is a semi-presidential republic with its capital in Paris, the nation's largest city and the main cultural and commercial center. The current Constitution of France, adopted by referendum on 4 October 1958, establishes the country as secular and democratic, with its sovereignty derived from the people. The nation's ideals are expressed in the <i>Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen<\/i>, one of the world's earliest documents on human rights, which was formulated during the seminal French Revolution of the late 18th century.<\/p>\n<p>France has been a major power in Europe since the Late Middle Ages, reaching the height of global prominence during the 19th and early 20th centuries, when it possessed the second-largest colonial empire in the world. Throughout its long history, France has produced many influential artists, thinkers, and scientists, and remains a prominent global center of culture. It hosts the world's fourth-largest number of cultural UNESCO World Heritage Sites and receives around 83 million foreign tourists annually – the most of any country in the world.<\/p>\n<p>France remains a great power with significant cultural, economic, military, and political influence in Europe and around the world. It has the world's fifth-largest military budget, third-largest stockpile of nuclear weapons, and second-largest diplomatic corps. Due to its overseas regions and territories throughout the world, France has the second-largest exclusive economic zone in the world. France is a developed country and has the world's fifth-largest economy by nominal GDP and seventh-largest by purchasing power parity. In terms of total household wealth, France is the wealthiest nation in Europe and fourth in the world.<\/p>\n<p>French citizens enjoy a high standard of living, and the country performs well in international rankings of education, health care, life expectancy, civil liberties, and human development. France is a founding member of the United Nations, where it serves as one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council. It is a member of numerous international institutions, including the Group of 7, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the World Trade Organization (WTO), and La Francophonie.

Mali is bordered by Algeria to the north, Niger to the east, Burkina Faso to the south, Guinea to the south-west, and Senegal and Mauritania to the west. Its size is just over 1,240,000 square kilometres (480,000 sq mi) with a population of 14.5 million. Its capital is Bamako.<\/p>\n<p>Mali consists of eight regions and its borders on the north reach deep into the middle of the Sahara, while the country's southern part, where the majority of inhabitants live, features the Niger and Senegal rivers. The country's economic structure centers on agriculture and fishing. Some of Mali's prominent natural resources include gold, being the third largest producer of gold in the African continent, and salt. About half the population lives below the international poverty line of US$1.25 a day.<\/p>\n<p>Present-day Mali was once part of three West African empires that controlled trans-Saharan trade: the Ghana Empire, the Mali Empire (for which Mali is named), and the Songhai Empire. During its golden age, there was a flourishing of mathematics, astronomy, literature, and art. At its peak in 1300, the Mali Empire covered an area about twice the size of modern-day France, and stretched to the west coast of Africa. In the late 19th century, during the Scramble for Africa, France seized control of Mali, making it a part of French Sudan. French Sudan (then known as the Sudanese Republic) joined with Senegal in 1959, achieving independence in 1960 as the Mali Federation. Shortly thereafter, following Senegal's withdrawal from the federation, the Sudanese Republic declared itself the independent Republic of Mali. After a long period of one-party rule, a 1991 coup led to the writing of a new constitution and the establishment of Mali as a democratic, multi-party state.<\/p>\n<p>In January 2012, an armed conflict broke out in northern Mali, which Tuareg rebels took control of by April and declared the secession of a new state, Azawad. The conflict was complicated by a military coup that took place in March and later fighting between Tuareg and Islamist rebels. In response to Islamist territorial gains, the French military launched Opération Serval in January 2013. A month later, Malian and French forces recaptured most of the north. Presidential elections were held on 28 July 2013, with a second round run-off held on 11 August, and legislative elections were held on 24 November 2013.<\/p>","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=1680","active":true,"facebookchat":"","slug":"mali","placetype":"Country","geohash":"egjhj021u80r","trend_rank_last":0,"local_url":"\/topic\/mali\/","longitude":-3.99883,"name":"Mali","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mali\">Wikipedia<\/a>","latitude":17.5798,"created_on":"2012-03-12T22:31:18","latest_item_date":"2015-03-17T19:25:51.103335","id":1680,"kind":"location","image_height":443,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/0\/08\/Mali_Regions.png","daily_count":0,"recent_count":0,"woeid":23424891,"links":"","livevideo":"","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=1680","muted_by_default":false,"wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mali","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/1680\/","twitter_username":null,"trend_rank_current":0,"category":"Country"},{"item_count":785,"image_width":1220,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/paris-ile-de-france-fr\/","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/IT","description":"<p><b>Paris<\/b> (<small>UK:<\/small> \/ˈpærɪs\/; <small>US:<\/small> \/ˈpɛərɪs\/; <small>French:<\/small> [paʁi]<small class=\"nowrap\"> ( )<\/small>) is the capital and most populous city of France.

Metropolitan France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean; due to its shape, it is often referred to in French as <i>l’Hexagone<\/i> (\"The Hexagon\"). France is one of only three countries (with Morocco and Spain) to have both Atlantic and Mediterranean coastlines.<\/p>\n<p>By area, France is the 42nd largest country in the world but the largest country in Western Europe and the European Union (EU), and the third-largest in Europe as a whole. With a population approaching 67 million, it is the 20th most populated country and the second-most populated country in the EU. France is a semi-presidential republic with its capital in Paris, the nation's largest city and the main cultural and commercial center. The current Constitution of France, adopted by referendum on 4 October 1958, establishes the country as secular and democratic, with its sovereignty derived from the people. The nation's ideals are expressed in the <i>Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen<\/i>, one of the world's earliest documents on human rights, which was formulated during the seminal French Revolution of the late 18th century.<\/p>\n<p>France has been a major power in Europe since the Late Middle Ages, reaching the height of global prominence during the 19th and early 20th centuries, when it possessed the second-largest colonial empire in the world. Throughout its long history, France has produced many influential artists, thinkers, and scientists, and remains a prominent global center of culture. It hosts the world's fourth-largest number of cultural UNESCO World Heritage Sites and receives around 83 million foreign tourists annually – the most of any country in the world.<\/p>\n<p>France remains a great power with significant cultural, economic, military, and political influence in Europe and around the world. It has the world's fifth-largest military budget, third-largest stockpile of nuclear weapons, and second-largest diplomatic corps. Due to its overseas regions and territories throughout the world, France has the second-largest exclusive economic zone in the world. France is a developed country and has the world's fifth-largest economy by nominal GDP and seventh-largest by purchasing power parity. In terms of total household wealth, France is the wealthiest nation in Europe and fourth in the world.<\/p>\n<p>French citizens enjoy a high standard of living, and the country performs well in international rankings of education, health care, life expectancy, civil liberties, and human development. France is a founding member of the United Nations, where it serves as one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council. It is a member of numerous international institutions, including the Group of 7, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the World Trade Organization (WTO), and La Francophonie.

Yemen is the second largest country in the peninsula, occupying 527,970 km<sup>2<\/sup> (203,850 sq mi). The coastline stretches for about 2,000 km (1,200 mi). It is bordered by Saudi Arabia to the north, the Red Sea to the west, the Gulf of Aden and Arabian Sea to the south, and Oman to the east. Its capital and largest city is Sana'a. Yemen's territory includes more than 200 islands. The largest of these is Socotra.<\/p>\n<p>Yemen was home of the Sabaeans (biblical Sheba), a trading state that flourished for over a thousand years and probably also included parts of modern-day Ethiopia and Eritrea. In 275 AD, the region came under the rule of the later Jewish influenced Himyarite Kingdom. Christianity arrived in the 4th century AD whereas Judaism and local Paganism was already established. Islam spread quickly in 7th century and Yemenite troops were crucial in the expansion of the early Islamic conquests. Administration of Yemen has long been notoriously difficult. Several dynasties emerged from the 9th to 16th century, the Rasulid being the strongest and most prosperous. The country was divided between the Ottoman and British empires in the early 20th century. The Zaydi Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen was established after World War I in North Yemen before the creation of Yemen Arab Republic in 1962. South Yemen remained a British protectorate until 1967. The two Yemeni states united to form the modern republic of Yemen in 1990.<\/p>\n<p>Yemen is a developing country. Yemen's economy is underdeveloped because Yemen underwent 11 civil wars and Yemen has limited natural resources. Under the rule of President Ali Abdullah Saleh, Yemen was described as a kleptocracy. According to the 2009 international corruption Perception Index by Transparency International, Yemen ranked 164 out of 182 countries surveyed. In January 2011, a series of street protests began against poverty, unemployment, corruption and against President Saleh. The street protests gradually resulted in the resignation of President Saleh, thus Yemen underwent its first revolution in 2011.<\/p>\n<p>The United States considers AQAP to be the \"most dangerous of all the franchises of Al-Qaeda\". The U.S sought a controlled transition that would enable their counter-terrorism operations to continue. Saleh handed over power to his vice president, Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi, and was granted immunity from prosecution. A National Dialogue Conference was launched on 18 March 2012 to reach consensus on major issues facing the country's future. The closing ceremony was held on 25 January 2014. Yemen will become a multi-region federal republic. President Hadi's term was extended for another year in order to appoint and monitor two committees: one to choose between two federal regions (North and South) or six, and the other one to draft a new constitution. The committees are expected to finish their assignments by January 2015.<\/p>","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=2642","active":true,"facebookchat":"","slug":"yemen","placetype":"Country","geohash":"t4f1bgey6n7c","trend_rank_last":0,"local_url":"\/topic\/yemen\/","longitude":47.8507,"name":"Yemen","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Yemen\">Wikipedia<\/a>","latitude":15.7967,"created_on":"2011-05-16T20:11:39","latest_item_date":"2015-03-23T17:40:52.087318","id":2642,"kind":"location","image_height":600,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/8\/89\/Flag_of_Yemen.svg","daily_count":3,"recent_count":0,"woeid":23425002,"links":"","livevideo":"","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=2642","muted_by_default":false,"wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Yemen","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/2642\/","twitter_username":null,"trend_rank_current":0,"category":"Country"},{"item_count":5,"image_width":null,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/abdul-malik-al-houthi\/","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/UhZ","description":"<p><b>Sheikh Sayyid Abdul-Malik al-Houthi<\/b> (born January 1, 1982) is a leader of the insurgency by Zaidi rebels.

Believed by Muslims and Bahá'ís to be a messenger and prophet of God, Muhammad is almost universally considered by Muslims as the last prophet sent by God to mankind. While non-Muslims regard Muhammad as the founder of Islam, Muslims consider him to have restored the unaltered original monotheistic faith of Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and other prophets.<\/p>\r\n<p>Born in about 570 CE in the Arabian city of Mecca, Muhammad was orphaned at an early age; he was raised under the care of his paternal uncle Abu Talib. After his childhood Muhammad primarily worked as a merchant. Occasionally he would retreat to a cave in the mountains for several nights of seclusion and prayer; later, at age 40, he reported at this spot, that he was visited by Gabriel and received his first revelation from God. Three years after this event Muhammad started preaching these revelations publicly, proclaiming that \"God is One\", that complete \"surrender\" (lit. <i>islām<\/i>) to Him is the only way (<i>dīn<\/i>) acceptable to God, and that he was a prophet and messenger of God, in the same vein as other Islamic prophets.<\/p>\r\n<p>Muhammad gained few followers early on, and met hostility from some Meccan tribes. To escape persecution, Muhammad sent some of his followers to Abyssinia before he and his followers in Mecca migrated to Medina (then known as Yathrib) in the year 622. This event, the Hijra, marks the beginning of the Islamic calendar, also known as the Hijri Calendar. In Medina, Muhammad united the tribes under the Constitution of Medina. After eight years of fighting with the Meccan tribes, Muhammad gathered an army of 10,000 Muslim converts and marched on the city of Mecca. The attack went largely uncontested and Muhammad took over the city with little bloodshed. He destroyed the pagan idols in the city and sent his followers out to destroy all remaining pagan temples in Eastern Arabia. In 632, a few months after returning to Medina from The Farewell Pilgrimage, Muhammad fell ill and died. Before his death, most of the Arabian Peninsula had converted to Islam, and he had united Arabia into a single Muslim religious polity.<\/p>\r\n<p>The revelations (each known as <i>Ayah<\/i>, lit. \"Sign [of God]\") which Muhammad reported receiving until his death form the verses of the Quran, regarded by Muslims as the \"Word of God\" and around which the religion is based. Besides the Quran, Muhammad's teachings and practices (<i>sunnah<\/i>), found in the Hadith and <i>sira<\/i> literature, are also upheld by Muslims and used as sources of Islamic law. Muslims discuss Muhammad and other prophets of Islam with reverence, adding the phrase <i>peace be upon him<\/i> whenever their names are mentioned. While conceptions of Muhammad in medieval Christendom and other premodern contexts were largely negative, appraisals in modern history have been far more favorable.<\/p>","items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=4617","active":true,"facebookchat":"","slug":"muhammad","placetype":"","geohash":"","trend_rank_last":0,"local_url":"\/topic\/muhammad\/","longitude":null,"name":"Muhammad","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Muhammad\">Wikipedia<\/a>","latitude":null,"created_on":"2011-04-13T00:12:52","latest_item_date":"2015-03-13T16:26:10.438633","id":4617,"kind":"tag","image_height":600,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/7\/73\/Al-Masjid_AL-Nabawi_Door.jpg","daily_count":0,"recent_count":0,"woeid":null,"links":"","livevideo":"","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=4617","muted_by_default":false,"wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Muhammad","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/4617\/","twitter_username":null,"trend_rank_current":0,"category":"Person"},{"item_count":29532,"image_width":589,"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/war-conflict\/","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/P","description":"<p><b>War<\/b> is an organized and often prolonged conflict that is carried out by states or non-state actors.
