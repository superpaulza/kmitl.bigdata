<p>The police officer who shot unarmed teenager Michael Brown to death in Ferguson, Missouri, did not know that Brown was a suspect in the robbery of a convenience store minutes earlier, the police chief said Friday.</p><p>Police Chief Thomas Jackson said that Brown and a friend were stopped “because they were walking down the middle of the street blocking traffic.”</p><p>Earlier in the day, police identified the officer who killed Brown as Darren Wilson, 28. They also released surveillance footage of the convenience store robbery, in which Brown was suspected of stealing a box of cigars and assaulting a clerk.</p><p>Brown’s family released a statement denouncing the police for smearing the teen’s name and blaming the victim. The statement described Brown’s death as a “brutal assassination” in broad daylight.</p><p>The police chief defended his decision to release the surveillance tape, saying that he was trying to satisfy the news media’s repeated requests for information.</p><p>“What I did was release the videotape to you because I had to,” he said. “I’ve been sitting on it, but too many people put in an FOI request for that, and I had to release it.” He was referring to requests under the Freedom of Information Act.</p><p>Asked about the family’s reaction, he said: “My response to that is, first, my heart goes out to the family. I can’t imagine what they’re going through. We have given you everything that we have now, and everything that we can give you.”</p><h5>— Erin McClam</h5>

His reports appear on all platforms of NBC News, including “Nightly News with Brian Williams,” “TODAY,” “Meet the Press,” “Dateline,” MSNBC, and NBCNews.com.</p><p>Engel, one of the only western journalists to cover the entire war in Iraq, joined NBC News in May 2003. He previously worked as a freelance journalist for ABC News, most notably during the initial U.S. invasion of Iraq. He remained in Baghdad as NBC's primary Iraq correspondent until his appointment as senior Middle East correspondent and Beirut bureau chief in May 2006. Engel also covered the war between Israel and Hezbollah in the summer of 2006 from Beirut and southern Lebanon.  </p><p>Prior to working for ABC News, Engel served as the Middle East correspondent for \"The World,\" a joint production of BBC World Service, Public Radio International (PRI) and WGBH-Boston radio from 2001-2003.
