Located in the northern part of the continent, it extends from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean. At 9.98 million square kilometres in total, Canada is the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Its common border with the United States is the world's longest land border shared by the same two countries.<\/p>\n<p>The land that is now Canada has been inhabited for millennia by various Aboriginal peoples. Beginning in the late 15th century, British and French colonies were established on the region's Atlantic coast. As a consequence of various conflicts, the United Kingdom gained and lost North American territories until left, in the late 18th century, with what mostly comprises Canada today. Pursuant to the British North America Act, on July 1, 1867 three colonies joined to form the autonomous federal dominion of Canada. This began an accretion of provinces and territories to the new self-governing dominion. In 1931, Britain granted Canada full independence in most matters with the Statute of Westminster 1931. The Canada Act 1982 severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the British parliament.<\/p>\n<p>Canada is a federal parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy, with Queen Elizabeth II as its head of state. Canada is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations. The country is officially bilingual at the federal level. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many countries, with a population of approximately 35 million as of December 2012. Its advanced economy is one of the largest in the world, relying chiefly upon its abundant natural resources and well-developed trade networks. Canada's long and complex relationship with the United States has had a significant impact on its economy and culture.<\/p>\n<p>Canada is a developed country and one of the wealthiest in the world, with the eighth highest per capita income globally, and the eighth highest ranking in the Human Development Index. It ranks among the highest in international measurements of education, government transparency, civil liberties, quality of life, and economic freedom.

A variety of methods are employed in politics, which include promoting one's own political views among people, negotiation with other political subjects, making laws, and exercising force, including warfare against adversaries.

The war followed the September 11 attacks, and its public aims were to dismantle al-Qaeda and denying it a safe basis of operation in Afghanistan by removing the Taliban from power.<\/p>\n<p>U.S. President George W. Bush demanded that the Taliban hand over Osama bin Laden and expel al-Qaeda. The Taliban asked bin Laden to leave the country, but declined to extradite him without evidence of his involvement in the 9\/11 attacks. The United States refused to negotiate and launched Operation Enduring Freedom on 7 October 2001 with the United Kingdom. The two were later joined by other forces, including the Northern Alliance. The U.S. and its allies drove the Taliban from power and built military bases near major cities across the country. Most al-Qaeda and Taliban were not captured, escaping to neighboring Pakistan or retreating to rural or remote mountainous regions.<\/p>\n<p>In December 2001, the United Nations Security Council established the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), to oversee military operations in the country and train Afghan National Security Forces. At the Bonn Conference in December 2001, Hamid Karzai was selected to head the Afghan Interim Administration, which after a 2002 loya jirga in Kabul became the Afghan Transitional Administration. In the popular elections of 2004, Karzai was elected president of the country, now named the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan.<\/p>\n<p>In 2003, NATO assumed leadership of ISAF, with troops from 43 countries. NATO members provided the core of the force. One portion of U.S. forces in Afghanistan operated under NATO command; the rest remained under direct U.S. command. Taliban leader Mullah Omar reorganized the movement and in 2003 launched an insurgency against the government and ISAF.<\/p>\n<p>Though vastly outgunned and outnumbered, the Taliban insurgents, most notably the Haqqani Network and Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin, have waged asymmetric warfare with guerilla raids and ambushes in the countryside, suicide attacks against urban targets and turncoat killings against coalition forces. The Taliban exploited weaknesses in the Afghan government, among the most corrupt in the world, to reassert influence across rural areas of southern and eastern Afghanistan. ISAF responded in 2006 by increasing troops for counterinsurgency operations to \"clear and hold\" villages and \"nation building\" projects to \"win hearts and minds\".<\/p>\n<p>While ISAF continued to battle the Taliban insurgency, fighting crossed into neighboring North-West Pakistan. In 2004, the Pakistani Army began to clash with local tribes hosting al-Qaeda and Taliban militants. The US military launched drone attacks in Pakistan to kill insurgent leaders. This resulted in the start of an insurgency in Waziristan in 2007.<\/p>\n<p>On 2 May 2011, United States Navy SEALs killed Osama bin Laden in Abbotabad, Pakistan. In May 2012, NATO leaders endorsed an exit strategy for withdrawing their forces. UN-backed peace talks have since taken place between the Afghan government and the Taliban. In May 2014, the United States announced that its combat operations would end in 2014, leaving just a small residual force in the country until the end of 2016.<\/p>\n<p>As of 2013, tens of thousands of people had been killed in the war. Over 4,000 ISAF soldiers and civilian contractors as well as over 10,000 Afghan National Security Forces had been killed.<\/p>","image_height":532,"geohash":"","latest_item_date":"2015-03-23T13:52:28.082967"},{"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=243","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=243","id":243,"created_on":"2011-05-16T20:24:11","recent_count":0,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/9\/9a\/Flag_of_Afghanistan.svg","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/afghanistan\/","daily_count":0,"trend_rank_last":194,"muted_by_default":false,"woeid":23424739,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/243\/","local_url":"\/topic\/afghanistan\/","placetype":"Country","links":"","kind":"location","name":"Afghanistan","category":"Country","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/D5","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Afghanistan","twitter_username":null,"slug":"afghanistan","facebookchat":"","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Afghanistan\">Wikipedia<\/a>","latitude":33.9305,"active":true,"item_count":2957,"image_width":600,"trend_rank_current":194,"longitude":67.6789,"livevideo":"","description":"<p><b>Afghanistan<\/b> \/æfˈɡænɨstæn\/ (Pashto\/Dari: افغانستان, <i>Afġānistān<\/i>), officially the <b>Islamic Republic of Afghanistan<\/b>, is a landlocked country located in Central Asia and South Asia.

At 9.98 million square kilometres in total, Canada is the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Its common border with the United States is the world's longest land border shared by the same two countries.<\/p>\n<p>The land that is now Canada has been inhabited for millennia by various Aboriginal peoples. Beginning in the late 15th century, British and French colonies were established on the region's Atlantic coast. As a consequence of various conflicts, the United Kingdom gained and lost North American territories until left, in the late 18th century, with what mostly comprises Canada today. Pursuant to the British North America Act, on July 1, 1867 three colonies joined to form the autonomous federal dominion of Canada. This began an accretion of provinces and territories to the new self-governing dominion. In 1931, Britain granted Canada full independence in most matters with the Statute of Westminster 1931. The Canada Act 1982 severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the British parliament.<\/p>\n<p>Canada is a federal parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy, with Queen Elizabeth II as its head of state. Canada is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations. The country is officially bilingual at the federal level. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many countries, with a population of approximately 35 million as of December 2012. Its advanced economy is one of the largest in the world, relying chiefly upon its abundant natural resources and well-developed trade networks. Canada's long and complex relationship with the United States has had a significant impact on its economy and culture.<\/p>\n<p>Canada is a developed country and one of the wealthiest in the world, with the eighth highest per capita income globally, and the eighth highest ranking in the Human Development Index.

Iraq was placed under the authority of the United Kingdom as the British Mandate of Mesopotamia. A monarchy was established in 1921 and the Kingdom of Iraq gained independence from Britain in 1932. In 1958, the monarchy was overthrown and the Republic of Iraq was created. Iraq was controlled by the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party from 1968 until 2003. After an invasion by the United States of America and its allies, Saddam Hussein's Ba'ath Party was removed from power and multi-party parliamentary elections were held.

One proposed definition is that a <b>crime<\/b>, also called an <b>offence<\/b> or a <b>criminal offence<\/b>, is an act harmful not only to some individual, but also to the community or the state (a public wrong).

History of political thought can be traced back to early antiquity, with seminal works such as Plato's <i>Republic<\/i>, Aristotle's <i>Politics<\/i> and the works of Confucius.<\/p>","image_height":788,"geohash":"","latest_item_date":"2015-03-24T00:39:46.820818"},{"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=15","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=15","id":15,"created_on":"2012-11-28T17:18:48","recent_count":2,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/a\/a7\/Cyprian_War.jpg","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/war-conflict\/","daily_count":25,"trend_rank_last":17,"muted_by_default":false,"woeid":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/15\/","local_url":"\/topic\/war-conflict\/","placetype":"","links":"","kind":"vertical","name":"war & conflict","category":"Topic","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/P","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/War","twitter_username":null,"slug":"war-conflict","facebookchat":"","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/War\">Wikipedia<\/a>","latitude":null,"active":true,"item_count":29522,"image_width":589,"trend_rank_current":17,"longitude":null,"livevideo":"","description":"<p><b>War<\/b> is an organized and often prolonged conflict that is carried out by states or non-state actors. It is generally characterised by extreme violence, social disruption and economic destruction. War should be understood as an actual, intentional and widespread armed conflict between political communities, and therefore is defined as a form of (collective) political violence or intervention. The set of techniques used by a group to carry out war is known as <b>warfare<\/b>. An absence of war is usually called peace.<\/p>\n<p>While some scholars see warfare as an inescapable and integral aspect of human nature, others argue that it is only inevitable under certain socio-cultural or ecological circumstances. For some the practice of war is not linked to any single type of political organization or society. Rather, as discussed by John Keegan in his <i>A History of Warfare<\/i>, war is a universal phenomenon whose form and scope is defined by the society that wages it. Another argument suggests that since there are human societies in which warfare does not exist, humans may not be naturally disposed for warfare, which emerges under particular circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>The deadliest war in history, in terms of the cumulative number of deaths since its start, is the Second World War, with 60–85 million deaths, followed by the Mongol conquests. Proportionally speaking, the most destructive war in modern history is the War of the Triple Alliance, which took the lives of over 60% of Paraguay's population, according to Steven Pinker. In 2003, Richard Smalley identified war as the sixth (of ten) biggest problems facing humanity for the next fifty years.<\/p>","image_height":768,"geohash":"","latest_item_date":"2015-03-23T23:42:47.566836"}]},{"push_content":"Commissioner of the RCMP says there is still an active investigation into whether anyone assisted Michael Zehaf-Bibeau in Ottawa attack - @KatieSimpsonCTV","shortened_url":"http:\/\/bit.ly\/1ETS8oR","id":525731,"type":"text","author":{"username":"stephanie.clary","id":8,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/user\/8\/","email":"stephanie.clary@breakingnews.com","last_name":"Clary","first_name":"Stephanie","is_staff":true,"full_name":"Stephanie Clary"},"permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/item\/2015\/03\/06\/commissioner-of-the-rcmp-says-there-is-still-an-ac","media":null,"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/KatieSimpsonCTV\/status\/573877515770552321","content":"Commissioner of the RCMP says there is still an active investigation into whether anyone assisted Michael Zehaf-Bibeau in Ottawa attack - @KatieSimpsonCTV","date_ap":"Mar 06, 2015, 04:09 PM GMT","status":"published","resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/525731\/","local_url":"\/item\/2015\/03\/06\/commissioner-of-the-rcmp-says-there-is-still-an-ac","pushed":true,"data_type":null,"submitter":"editor","tweet":{"content":"Commissioner of the RCMP says there is still an active investigation into whether anyone assisted MZB in Ottawa terror attack","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/KatieSimpsonCTV\/status\/573877515770552321","id":317926,"user_id":"24215395","screen_name":"KatieSimpsonCTV","resource_uri":"","name":"Katie Simpson","location":"where the news goes","avatar":"http:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/518092721547132928\/suHGl6Ya_normal.jpeg","tweet_id":"573877515770552321","date":"2015-03-06T16:07:16"},"data":null,"short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/i\/CMvh","slug":"commissioner-of-the-rcmp-says-there-is-still-an-ac","updated_date":"2015-03-06T16:09:49.235851","note":null,"whoas":9,"date":"2015-03-06T16:09:46.199569","source":null,"url_domain":"twitter.com","importance":2,"topics":[{"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=87613","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=87613","id":87613,"created_on":"2014-10-22T14:17:06.376391","recent_count":0,"image_url":"","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/shooting-near-ottowa-war-memorial-oct-22-2014\/","daily_count":1,"trend_rank_last":0,"muted_by_default":false,"woeid":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/87613\/","local_url":"\/topic\/shooting-near-ottowa-war-memorial-oct-22-2014\/","placetype":"","links":"","kind":"arc","name":"Ottawa shootings, Oct. 22, 2014","category":"CrimeCourtsEvent","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/WxH","wikipedia_url":"","twitter_username":null,"slug":"shooting-near-ottowa-war-memorial-oct-22-2014","facebookchat":"","image_credit":"","latitude":null,"active":true,"item_count":169,"image_width":null,"trend_rank_current":0,"longitude":null,"livevideo":"","description":"<p>Police said there were three separate shootings in Canada's capital, prompting a lockdown at Parliament Hill on Oct. 22, 2014.

The term crime does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law (i.e. something is a crime if applicable law says that it is). One proposed definition is that a <b>crime<\/b>, also called an <b>offence<\/b> or a <b>criminal offence<\/b>, is an act harmful not only to some individual, but also to the community or the state (a public wrong). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\r\n<p>The idea that acts like murder, rape and theft are prohibited exists all around the world. What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country. While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.<\/p>\r\n<p>The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime.

Only if found guilty, the offender may be sentenced to punishment such as community sentence, imprisonment, life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions, even death.<\/p>\r\n<p>To be classified as a crime, the act of doing something bad (actus reus) must be usually accompanied by the intention to do something bad (mens rea), with certain exceptions (strict liability).<\/p>\r\n<p>While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime.

The term crime does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law (i.e. something is a crime if applicable law says that it is). One proposed definition is that a <b>crime<\/b>, also called an <b>offence<\/b> or a <b>criminal offence<\/b>, is an act harmful not only to some individual, but also to the community or the state (a public wrong). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\r\n<p>The idea that acts like murder, rape and theft are prohibited exists all around the world. What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country. While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.<\/p>\r\n<p>The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime. Therefore, in modern societies, a criminal procedure must be adhered to during the investigation and trial. Only if found guilty, the offender may be sentenced to punishment such as community sentence, imprisonment, life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions, even death.<\/p>\r\n<p>To be classified as a crime, the act of doing something bad (actus reus) must be usually accompanied by the intention to do something bad (mens rea), with certain exceptions (strict liability).<\/p>\r\n<p>While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime.

Its common border with the United States is the world's longest land border shared by the same two countries.<\/p>\n<p>The land that is now Canada has been inhabited for millennia by various Aboriginal peoples. Beginning in the late 15th century, British and French colonies were established on the region's Atlantic coast. As a consequence of various conflicts, the United Kingdom gained and lost North American territories until left, in the late 18th century, with what mostly comprises Canada today. Pursuant to the British North America Act, on July 1, 1867 three colonies joined to form the autonomous federal dominion of Canada. This began an accretion of provinces and territories to the new self-governing dominion. In 1931, Britain granted Canada full independence in most matters with the Statute of Westminster 1931. The Canada Act 1982 severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the British parliament.<\/p>\n<p>Canada is a federal parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy, with Queen Elizabeth II as its head of state. Canada is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations. The country is officially bilingual at the federal level. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many countries, with a population of approximately 35 million as of December 2012. Its advanced economy is one of the largest in the world, relying chiefly upon its abundant natural resources and well-developed trade networks.

On July 4, 1776, as the colonies were fighting Great Britain in the American Revolutionary War, delegates from the 13 colonies unanimously issued the Declaration of Independence. The war ended in 1783 with the recognition of independence of the United States from the Kingdom of Great Britain, and was the first successful war of independence against a European colonial empire. The current Constitution was adopted on September 17, 1787. The first ten amendments, collectively named the Bill of Rights, were ratified in 1791 and guarantee many fundamental civil rights and freedoms.<\/p>\n<p>Driven by the doctrine of manifest destiny, the United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century. This involved displacing native tribes, acquiring new territories, and gradually admitting new states. The American Civil War ended legal slavery in the country. By the end of the 19th century, the United States extended into the Pacific Ocean, and its economy was the world's largest. The Spanish–American War and World War I confirmed the country's status as a global military power. The United States emerged from World War II as a global superpower, the first country with nuclear weapons, and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. The end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union left the United States as the sole superpower.<\/p>\n<p>The United States is a developed country and has the world's largest national economy, with an estimated GDP in 2013 of $16.8 trillion—23% of global nominal GDP and 19% at purchasing-power parity.

While the U.S. economy is considered post-industrial, it continues to be one of the world's largest manufacturers. The U.S. has the highest mean and 4th highest median household income in the OECD as well as the highest gross average wage, though it has the 4th most unequal income distribution, with roughly 15% of the population living in poverty as defined by the U.S. Census.

Kerry was the candidate of the Democratic Party in the 2004 presidential election but lost to George W. Bush. Kerry was born in Aurora, Colorado and attended boarding school in Massachusetts and New Hampshire. He graduated from Yale University class of 1966 with a political science major, and was a member of the Skull and Bones secret society. Kerry enlisted in the Naval Reserve in 1966, and during 1968–1969 served an abbreviated four-month tour of duty in South Vietnam as officer-in-charge (OIC) of a Swift Boat. For that service, he was awarded combat medals that include the Silver Star, Bronze Star, and three Purple Hearts. Securing an early return to the United States, Kerry joined the Vietnam Veterans Against the War in which he served as a nationally recognized spokesman and as an outspoken opponent of the Vietnam War. He appeared before the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs where he deemed United States war policy in Vietnam to be the cause of \"war crimes.\"<\/p>\n<p>After receiving his J.D. from Boston College Law School, Kerry worked as an Assistant District Attorney. He served as Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts under Michael Dukakis from 1983 to 1985. He won the Democratic primary in 1984 for the U.S. Senate and was sworn in the following January. On the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he led a series of hearings from 1987 to 1989 which were a precursor to the Iran–Contra affair. Kerry was reelected to additional terms in 1990, 1996, 2002, and 2008. In 2002, Kerry voted to authorize the President \"to use force, if necessary, to disarm Saddam Hussein\", but warned that the administration should exhaust its diplomatic avenues before launching war. In his 2004 presidential campaign, Kerry criticized George W. Bush for the Iraq War. He and his running mate Senator John Edwards lost the race, finishing 35 electoral votes behind Bush-Cheney. Subsequently, he established the Keeping America's Promise PAC. Kerry became chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 2009. Having been nominated by President Barack Obama to succeed outgoing Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and then confirmed by the U.S. Senate by a vote of 94–3 on January 29, 2013, Kerry assumed the office on February 1, 2013.<\/p>","image_height":512,"geohash":"","latest_item_date":"2015-03-23T18:07:19.394182"},{"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=85237","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=85237","id":85237,"created_on":"2014-10-03T17:03:46.807847","recent_count":0,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/en\/1\/1a\/Badge_of_the_Parliament_of_Canada.jpg","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/parliament-of-canada\/","daily_count":1,"trend_rank_last":0,"muted_by_default":false,"woeid":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/85237\/","local_url":"\/topic\/parliament-of-canada\/","placetype":"","links":"","kind":"tag","name":"Parliament of Canada","category":"Organization","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/WKx","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Parliament_of_Canada","twitter_username":null,"slug":"parliament-of-canada","facebookchat":"","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Parliament_of_Canada\">Wikipedia<\/a>","latitude":null,"active":true,"item_count":16,"image_width":490,"trend_rank_current":0,"longitude":null,"livevideo":"","description":"<p>The <b>Parliament of Canada<\/b> (French: <i>Parlement du Canada<\/i>) is the federal legislative branch of Canada, seated at Parliament Hill in the national capital, Ottawa, Ontario.

Common definitions of terrorism refer only to those violent acts that are intended to create fear (terror); are perpetrated for a religious, political, or ideological goal; and deliberately target or disregard the safety of non-combatants (e.g., neutral military personnel or civilians). Some definitions now include acts of unlawful violence and war. The use of similar tactics by criminal organizations for protection rackets or to enforce a code of silence is usually not labeled terrorism, though these same actions may be labeled terrorism when done by a politically motivated group. Usage of the term has also been criticized for its frequent undue equating with <i>Islamism<\/i> or <i>jihadism<\/i>, while ignoring non-Islamic organizations or individuals.<\/p>\r\n<p>The word \"terrorism\" is politically loaded and emotionally charged, and this greatly compounds the difficulty of providing a precise definition. Studies have found over 100 definitions of \"terrorism\". In some cases, the same group may be described as \"freedom fighters\" by its supporters and considered to be terrorists by its opponents. The concept of terrorism may be controversial as it is often used by state authorities (and individuals with access to state support) to delegitimize political or other opponents, and potentially legitimize the state's own use of armed force against opponents (such use of force may be described as \"terror\" by opponents of the state). At the same time, the reverse may also take place when states perpetrate or are accused of perpetrating state terrorism. The usage of the term has a controversial history, with individuals such as ANC leader Nelson Mandela at one point also branded a terrorist.<\/p>\r\n<p>Terrorism has been practiced by a broad array of political organizations to further their objectives. It has been practiced by both right-wing and left-wing political parties, nationalistic groups, religious groups, revolutionaries, and ruling governments. An abiding characteristic is the indiscriminate use of violence against non-combatants for the purpose of gaining publicity for a group, cause, or individual. The symbolism of terrorism can exploit human fear to help achieve these goals.<\/p>","image_height":925,"geohash":"","latest_item_date":"2015-03-23T08:46:24.874494"},{"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=475","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=475","id":475,"created_on":"2010-05-19T15:49:34","recent_count":0,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/1\/1e\/Department_of_state.svg","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/united-states-department-of-state\/","daily_count":2,"trend_rank_last":45,"muted_by_default":false,"woeid":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/475\/","local_url":"\/topic\/united-states-department-of-state\/","placetype":"","links":"","kind":"tag","name":"United States Department of State","category":"Organization","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Hp","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States_Department_of_State","twitter_username":null,"slug":"united-states-department-of-state","facebookchat":"","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States_Department_of_State\">Wikipedia<\/a>","latitude":null,"active":true,"item_count":1814,"image_width":720,"trend_rank_current":46,"longitude":null,"livevideo":"","description":"<p>The <b>United States Department of State<\/b> (<b>DoS<\/b>), often referred to as the <b>State Department<\/b>, is the United States federal executive department responsible for international relations of the United States, equivalent to the foreign ministry of other countries.

It is generally characterised by extreme violence, social disruption and economic destruction. War should be understood as an actual, intentional and widespread armed conflict between political communities, and therefore is defined as a form of (collective) political violence or intervention. The set of techniques used by a group to carry out war is known as <b>warfare<\/b>. An absence of war is usually called peace.<\/p>\n<p>While some scholars see warfare as an inescapable and integral aspect of human nature, others argue that it is only inevitable under certain socio-cultural or ecological circumstances. For some the practice of war is not linked to any single type of political organization or society. Rather, as discussed by John Keegan in his <i>A History of Warfare<\/i>, war is a universal phenomenon whose form and scope is defined by the society that wages it. Another argument suggests that since there are human societies in which warfare does not exist, humans may not be naturally disposed for warfare, which emerges under particular circumstances.<\/p>\n<p>The deadliest war in history, in terms of the cumulative number of deaths since its start, is the Second World War, with 60–85 million deaths, followed by the Mongol conquests.

Located in the northern part of the continent, it extends from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean. At 9.98 million square kilometres in total, Canada is the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Its common border with the United States is the world's longest land border shared by the same two countries.<\/p>\n<p>The land that is now Canada has been inhabited for millennia by various Aboriginal peoples. Beginning in the late 15th century, British and French colonies were established on the region's Atlantic coast. As a consequence of various conflicts, the United Kingdom gained and lost North American territories until left, in the late 18th century, with what mostly comprises Canada today. Pursuant to the British North America Act, on July 1, 1867 three colonies joined to form the autonomous federal dominion of Canada. This began an accretion of provinces and territories to the new self-governing dominion. In 1931, Britain granted Canada full independence in most matters with the Statute of Westminster 1931. The Canada Act 1982 severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the British parliament.<\/p>\n<p>Canada is a federal parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy, with Queen Elizabeth II as its head of state. Canada is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations. The country is officially bilingual at the federal level. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many countries, with a population of approximately 35 million as of December 2012. Its advanced economy is one of the largest in the world, relying chiefly upon its abundant natural resources and well-developed trade networks. Canada's long and complex relationship with the United States has had a significant impact on its economy and culture.<\/p>\n<p>Canada is a developed country and one of the wealthiest in the world, with the eighth highest per capita income globally, and the eighth highest ranking in the Human Development Index. It ranks among the highest in international measurements of education, government transparency, civil liberties, quality of life, and economic freedom. Canada also ranks among the world's most educated countries, and was ranked first worldwide in the number of adults having tertiary education with 51% of adults having attained at least an undergraduate college or university degree according to OECD's 2012 survey. Canada's participation in economic international and intergovernmental institutions or groupings includes the G8 (Group of Eight); the Group of Ten (economic); the Group of Twenty (G-20 major economies); the North American Free Trade Agreement; and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.

The geography and climate of the United States is also extremely diverse, and it is home to a wide variety of wildlife.<\/p>\n<p>Paleo-Indians migrated from Eurasia to what is now the U.S. mainland around 15,000 years ago, with European colonization beginning in the 16th century. The United States emerged from 13 British colonies located along the Atlantic seaboard. Disputes between Great Britain and these colonies led to the American Revolution. On July 4, 1776, as the colonies were fighting Great Britain in the American Revolutionary War, delegates from the 13 colonies unanimously issued the Declaration of Independence. The war ended in 1783 with the recognition of independence of the United States from the Kingdom of Great Britain, and was the first successful war of independence against a European colonial empire. The current Constitution was adopted on September 17, 1787. The first ten amendments, collectively named the Bill of Rights, were ratified in 1791 and guarantee many fundamental civil rights and freedoms.<\/p>\n<p>Driven by the doctrine of manifest destiny, the United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century. This involved displacing native tribes, acquiring new territories, and gradually admitting new states. The American Civil War ended legal slavery in the country. By the end of the 19th century, the United States extended into the Pacific Ocean, and its economy was the world's largest. The Spanish–American War and World War I confirmed the country's status as a global military power. The United States emerged from World War II as a global superpower, the first country with nuclear weapons, and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. The end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union left the United States as the sole superpower.<\/p>\n<p>The United States is a developed country and has the world's largest national economy, with an estimated GDP in 2013 of $16.8 trillion—23% of global nominal GDP and 19% at purchasing-power parity. The economy is fueled by an abundance of natural resources and high worker productivity, with per capita GDP being the world's sixth-highest in 2010. While the U.S. economy is considered post-industrial, it continues to be one of the world's largest manufacturers. The U.S. has the highest mean and 4th highest median household income in the OECD as well as the highest gross average wage, though it has the 4th most unequal income distribution, with roughly 15% of the population living in poverty as defined by the U.S. Census.

After the Conservatives' defeat to Dalton McGuinty's Ontario Liberal Party, he was the party's critic for key portfolios including finance, culture and health. Baird has been a member of the Conservatives since 1985, when he was the youngest delegate at that time and was also a political aide for the federal Progressive Conservative Party of Canada in the late 1980s.<\/p>\n<p>Since his beginning in the political ranks, Baird has been well known for being politically vocal on many subjects in the provincial and federal levels of government. During his tenure in the Harris Cabinet, he adopted several cost-saving measures, including reductions in discretionary government spending and an attempt to sell Hydro One, the government-owned utility firm. As the federal President of the Treasury Board in the Harper Cabinet, he adopted the Federal Accountability Act, which was put in place after the Gomery Commission which investigated the federal sponsorship scandal in the late 1990s and early 2000s. As Environment Minister, Baird signalled the Canadian government's opposition to the Kyoto Protocol whose targets have been functionally ignored since its symbolic ratification by the Chretien government.<\/p>","image_height":3000,"geohash":"","latest_item_date":"2015-02-03T16:40:01.493657"},{"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=63","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=63","id":63,"created_on":"2010-07-27T21:20:25","recent_count":0,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/2\/2c\/John_Kerry_official_Secretary_of_State_portrait.jpg","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/john-kerry\/","daily_count":1,"trend_rank_last":87,"muted_by_default":false,"woeid":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/63\/","local_url":"\/topic\/john-kerry\/","placetype":"","links":"","kind":"tag","name":"John Kerry","category":"Person","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/BB","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/John_Kerry","twitter_username":null,"slug":"john-kerry","facebookchat":"","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/John_Kerry\">Wikipedia<\/a>","latitude":null,"active":true,"item_count":1446,"image_width":404,"trend_rank_current":87,"longitude":null,"livevideo":"","description":"<p><b>John Forbes Kerry<\/b> (born December 11, 1943) is an American politician who is the 68th and current United States Secretary of State. He has served in the United States Senate, and was chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Kerry was the candidate of the Democratic Party in the 2004 presidential election but lost to George W. Bush. Kerry was born in Aurora, Colorado and attended boarding school in Massachusetts and New Hampshire. He graduated from Yale University class of 1966 with a political science major, and was a member of the Skull and Bones secret society. Kerry enlisted in the Naval Reserve in 1966, and during 1968–1969 served an abbreviated four-month tour of duty in South Vietnam as officer-in-charge (OIC) of a Swift Boat. For that service, he was awarded combat medals that include the Silver Star, Bronze Star, and three Purple Hearts. Securing an early return to the United States, Kerry joined the Vietnam Veterans Against the War in which he served as a nationally recognized spokesman and as an outspoken opponent of the Vietnam War. He appeared before the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs where he deemed United States war policy in Vietnam to be the cause of \"war crimes.\"<\/p>\n<p>After receiving his J.D. from Boston College Law School, Kerry worked as an Assistant District Attorney. He served as Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts under Michael Dukakis from 1983 to 1985. He won the Democratic primary in 1984 for the U.S. Senate and was sworn in the following January. On the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he led a series of hearings from 1987 to 1989 which were a precursor to the Iran–Contra affair. Kerry was reelected to additional terms in 1990, 1996, 2002, and 2008. In 2002, Kerry voted to authorize the President \"to use force, if necessary, to disarm Saddam Hussein\", but warned that the administration should exhaust its diplomatic avenues before launching war. In his 2004 presidential campaign, Kerry criticized George W. Bush for the Iraq War. He and his running mate Senator John Edwards lost the race, finishing 35 electoral votes behind Bush-Cheney. Subsequently, he established the Keeping America's Promise PAC. Kerry became chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 2009. Having been nominated by President Barack Obama to succeed outgoing Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and then confirmed by the U.S. Senate by a vote of 94–3 on January 29, 2013, Kerry assumed the office on February 1, 2013.<\/p>","image_height":512,"geohash":"","latest_item_date":"2015-03-23T18:07:19.394182"},{"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=475","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=475","id":475,"created_on":"2010-05-19T15:49:34","recent_count":0,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/1\/1e\/Department_of_state.svg","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/united-states-department-of-state\/","daily_count":2,"trend_rank_last":45,"muted_by_default":false,"woeid":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/475\/","local_url":"\/topic\/united-states-department-of-state\/","placetype":"","links":"","kind":"tag","name":"United States Department of State","category":"Organization","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Hp","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States_Department_of_State","twitter_username":null,"slug":"united-states-department-of-state","facebookchat":"","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States_Department_of_State\">Wikipedia<\/a>","latitude":null,"active":true,"item_count":1814,"image_width":720,"trend_rank_current":46,"longitude":null,"livevideo":"","description":"<p>The <b>United States Department of State<\/b> (<b>DoS<\/b>), often referred to as the <b>State Department<\/b>, is the United States federal executive department responsible for international relations of the United States, equivalent to the foreign ministry of other countries.

The term crime does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes.

One proposed definition is that a <b>crime<\/b>, also called an <b>offence<\/b> or a <b>criminal offence<\/b>, is an act harmful not only to some individual, but also to the community or the state (a public wrong). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\r\n<p>The idea that acts like murder, rape and theft are prohibited exists all around the world. What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country. While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.<\/p>\r\n<p>The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime. Therefore, in modern societies, a criminal procedure must be adhered to during the investigation and trial. Only if found guilty, the offender may be sentenced to punishment such as community sentence, imprisonment, life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions, even death.<\/p>\r\n<p>To be classified as a crime, the act of doing something bad (actus reus) must be usually accompanied by the intention to do something bad (mens rea), with certain exceptions (strict liability).<\/p>\r\n<p>While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime.

Pursuant to the British North America Act, on July 1, 1867 three colonies joined to form the autonomous federal dominion of Canada. This began an accretion of provinces and territories to the new self-governing dominion. In 1931, Britain granted Canada full independence in most matters with the Statute of Westminster 1931.

On July 4, 1776, as the colonies were fighting Great Britain in the American Revolutionary War, delegates from the 13 colonies unanimously issued the Declaration of Independence. The war ended in 1783 with the recognition of independence of the United States from the Kingdom of Great Britain, and was the first successful war of independence against a European colonial empire. The current Constitution was adopted on September 17, 1787. The first ten amendments, collectively named the Bill of Rights, were ratified in 1791 and guarantee many fundamental civil rights and freedoms.<\/p>\n<p>Driven by the doctrine of manifest destiny, the United States embarked on a vigorous expansion across North America throughout the 19th century. This involved displacing native tribes, acquiring new territories, and gradually admitting new states. The American Civil War ended legal slavery in the country.

The Spanish–American War and World War I confirmed the country's status as a global military power. The United States emerged from World War II as a global superpower, the first country with nuclear weapons, and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. The end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union left the United States as the sole superpower.<\/p>\n<p>The United States is a developed country and has the world's largest national economy, with an estimated GDP in 2013 of $16.8 trillion—23% of global nominal GDP and 19% at purchasing-power parity. The economy is fueled by an abundance of natural resources and high worker productivity, with per capita GDP being the world's sixth-highest in 2010. While the U.S. economy is considered post-industrial, it continues to be one of the world's largest manufacturers. The U.S. has the highest mean and 4th highest median household income in the OECD as well as the highest gross average wage, though it has the 4th most unequal income distribution, with roughly 15% of the population living in poverty as defined by the U.S. Census. The country accounts for 37% of global military spending, being the world's foremost economic and military power, a prominent political and cultural force, and a leader in scientific research and technological innovation.<\/p>","image_height":650,"geohash":"9yeg6ypy9wsp","latest_item_date":"2015-03-23T19:09:43.114314"},{"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=25701","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=25701","id":25701,"created_on":"2012-06-09T18:20:53","recent_count":0,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/7\/7b\/John_Baird_Minister_of_Foreign_Affairs.jpg","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/john-baird\/","daily_count":0,"trend_rank_last":0,"muted_by_default":false,"woeid":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/25701\/","local_url":"\/topic\/john-baird\/","placetype":"","links":"","kind":"tag","name":"John Baird","category":"Person","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Gqh","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/John_Baird_(Canadian_politician)","twitter_username":null,"slug":"john-baird","facebookchat":"","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/John_Baird_(Canadian_politician)\">Wikipedia<\/a>","latitude":null,"active":true,"item_count":20,"image_width":2400,"trend_rank_current":0,"longitude":null,"livevideo":"","description":"<p><b>John Russell Baird<\/b>, PC, MP (born May 26, 1969) is a Canadian politician serving as the Minister of Foreign Affairs in the cabinet of Prime Minister Stephen Harper.<\/p>\n<p>Baird has held the posts of Minister of Transport, Infrastructure and Communities, Minister of the Environment and President of the Treasury Board.

After the Conservatives' defeat to Dalton McGuinty's Ontario Liberal Party, he was the party's critic for key portfolios including finance, culture and health. Baird has been a member of the Conservatives since 1985, when he was the youngest delegate at that time and was also a political aide for the federal Progressive Conservative Party of Canada in the late 1980s.<\/p>\n<p>Since his beginning in the political ranks, Baird has been well known for being politically vocal on many subjects in the provincial and federal levels of government. During his tenure in the Harris Cabinet, he adopted several cost-saving measures, including reductions in discretionary government spending and an attempt to sell Hydro One, the government-owned utility firm. As the federal President of the Treasury Board in the Harper Cabinet, he adopted the Federal Accountability Act, which was put in place after the Gomery Commission which investigated the federal sponsorship scandal in the late 1990s and early 2000s. As Environment Minister, Baird signalled the Canadian government's opposition to the Kyoto Protocol whose targets have been functionally ignored since its symbolic ratification by the Chretien government.<\/p>","image_height":3000,"geohash":"","latest_item_date":"2015-02-03T16:40:01.493657"},{"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=63","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=63","id":63,"created_on":"2010-07-27T21:20:25","recent_count":0,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/2\/2c\/John_Kerry_official_Secretary_of_State_portrait.jpg","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/john-kerry\/","daily_count":1,"trend_rank_last":87,"muted_by_default":false,"woeid":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/63\/","local_url":"\/topic\/john-kerry\/","placetype":"","links":"","kind":"tag","name":"John Kerry","category":"Person","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/BB","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/John_Kerry","twitter_username":null,"slug":"john-kerry","facebookchat":"","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/John_Kerry\">Wikipedia<\/a>","latitude":null,"active":true,"item_count":1446,"image_width":404,"trend_rank_current":87,"longitude":null,"livevideo":"","description":"<p><b>John Forbes Kerry<\/b> (born December 11, 1943) is an American politician who is the 68th and current United States Secretary of State. He has served in the United States Senate, and was chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Kerry was the candidate of the Democratic Party in the 2004 presidential election but lost to George W. Bush. Kerry was born in Aurora, Colorado and attended boarding school in Massachusetts and New Hampshire. He graduated from Yale University class of 1966 with a political science major, and was a member of the Skull and Bones secret society. Kerry enlisted in the Naval Reserve in 1966, and during 1968–1969 served an abbreviated four-month tour of duty in South Vietnam as officer-in-charge (OIC) of a Swift Boat. For that service, he was awarded combat medals that include the Silver Star, Bronze Star, and three Purple Hearts. Securing an early return to the United States, Kerry joined the Vietnam Veterans Against the War in which he served as a nationally recognized spokesman and as an outspoken opponent of the Vietnam War. He appeared before the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs where he deemed United States war policy in Vietnam to be the cause of \"war crimes.\"<\/p>\n<p>After receiving his J.D. from Boston College Law School, Kerry worked as an Assistant District Attorney. He served as Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts under Michael Dukakis from 1983 to 1985. He won the Democratic primary in 1984 for the U.S. Senate and was sworn in the following January. On the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he led a series of hearings from 1987 to 1989 which were a precursor to the Iran–Contra affair. Kerry was reelected to additional terms in 1990, 1996, 2002, and 2008. In 2002, Kerry voted to authorize the President \"to use force, if necessary, to disarm Saddam Hussein\", but warned that the administration should exhaust its diplomatic avenues before launching war. In his 2004 presidential campaign, Kerry criticized George W. Bush for the Iraq War. He and his running mate Senator John Edwards lost the race, finishing 35 electoral votes behind Bush-Cheney. Subsequently, he established the Keeping America's Promise PAC. Kerry became chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 2009. Having been nominated by President Barack Obama to succeed outgoing Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and then confirmed by the U.S. Senate by a vote of 94–3 on January 29, 2013, Kerry assumed the office on February 1, 2013.<\/p>","image_height":512,"geohash":"","latest_item_date":"2015-03-23T18:07:19.394182"},{"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=475","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=475","id":475,"created_on":"2010-05-19T15:49:34","recent_count":0,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/1\/1e\/Department_of_state.svg","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/united-states-department-of-state\/","daily_count":2,"trend_rank_last":45,"muted_by_default":false,"woeid":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/475\/","local_url":"\/topic\/united-states-department-of-state\/","placetype":"","links":"","kind":"tag","name":"United States Department of State","category":"Organization","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Hp","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States_Department_of_State","twitter_username":null,"slug":"united-states-department-of-state","facebookchat":"","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States_Department_of_State\">Wikipedia<\/a>","latitude":null,"active":true,"item_count":1814,"image_width":720,"trend_rank_current":46,"longitude":null,"livevideo":"","description":"<p>The <b>United States Department of State<\/b> (<b>DoS<\/b>), often referred to as the <b>State Department<\/b>, is the United States federal executive department responsible for international relations of the United States, equivalent to the foreign ministry of other countries.

The term crime does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law (i.e. something is a crime if applicable law says that it is). One proposed definition is that a <b>crime<\/b>, also called an <b>offence<\/b> or a <b>criminal offence<\/b>, is an act harmful not only to some individual, but also to the community or the state (a public wrong). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\r\n<p>The idea that acts like murder, rape and theft are prohibited exists all around the world. What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country. While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.<\/p>\r\n<p>The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime. Therefore, in modern societies, a criminal procedure must be adhered to during the investigation and trial. Only if found guilty, the offender may be sentenced to punishment such as community sentence, imprisonment, life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions, even death.<\/p>\r\n<p>To be classified as a crime, the act of doing something bad (actus reus) must be usually accompanied by the intention to do something bad (mens rea), with certain exceptions (strict liability).<\/p>\r\n<p>While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime.

Its common border with the United States is the world's longest land border shared by the same two countries.<\/p>\n<p>The land that is now Canada has been inhabited for millennia by various Aboriginal peoples. Beginning in the late 15th century, British and French colonies were established on the region's Atlantic coast. As a consequence of various conflicts, the United Kingdom gained and lost North American territories until left, in the late 18th century, with what mostly comprises Canada today. Pursuant to the British North America Act, on July 1, 1867 three colonies joined to form the autonomous federal dominion of Canada. This began an accretion of provinces and territories to the new self-governing dominion. In 1931, Britain granted Canada full independence in most matters with the Statute of Westminster 1931. The Canada Act 1982 severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the British parliament.<\/p>\n<p>Canada is a federal parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy, with Queen Elizabeth II as its head of state. Canada is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations. The country is officially bilingual at the federal level. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many countries, with a population of approximately 35 million as of December 2012. Its advanced economy is one of the largest in the world, relying chiefly upon its abundant natural resources and well-developed trade networks.

A Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) investigation into the shootings is ongoing.<\/p>\n<p>The attacker, Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, was a 32 year-old Canadian habitual offender and drug addict from Montreal. Considered by several acquaintances to have mental issues, he had been observed by acquaintances and mosque staff exhibiting erratic behaviour. Zehaf-Bibeau, who had a Libyan-Canadian father, had converted to Islam in 2004 and visited Libya. At the time of the shooting, Zehaf-Bibeau planned to leave Canada for the Middle East, living in a homeless shelter in Ottawa while waiting for the processing of his Canadian passport application. According to RCMP Commissioner Bob Paulson the \"passport issue was central to what was driving\" Zehaf-Bibeau. According to the RCMP, Zehaf-Bibeau made a video prior to the attack in which he allegedly expressed his motives as being related \"to Canada's foreign policy and in respect of his religious beliefs.\" To acquaintances and co-workers, he had previously expressed support for jihadists and others in the Middle East resisting the West's intervention, but was not known to the police to be a terrorism risk.

The two incidents, which attracted international attention, raised concerns about the effectiveness of police actions to prevent terrorist attacks, the prevention of radicalization and the security measures in-place at federal and provincial legislatures. The Canadian government had already prepared a bill to expand the powers and courtroom anonymity and surveillance powers of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), Canada's spy agency, which was due to be introduced the day of the shootings, and was postponed by the event.

Harper became prime minister in 2006, forming a minority government after the 2006 election. He is the first prime minister to come from the newly reconstituted Conservative Party, which formed after a merger of the Progressive Conservative Party and the Canadian Alliance.<\/p>\n<p>Harper has been the Member of Parliament (MP) for the riding of Calgary Southwest in Alberta since 2002. Earlier, from 1993 to 1997, he was the MP for Calgary West. He was one of the founding members of the Reform Party, but did not seek re-election in the 1997 federal election. Harper instead joined and later led the National Citizens Coalition, a conservative lobbyist group. In 2002, he succeeded Stockwell Day as leader of the Canadian Alliance (the successor to the Reform Party) and returned to parliament as Leader of the Opposition. In 2003, he reached an agreement with Progressive Conservative leader Peter MacKay for the merger of their two parties to form the Conservative Party of Canada. He was elected as the party's first non-interim leader in March 2004.<\/p>\n<p>Harper's Conservative Party won a stronger minority in the October 2008 federal election, showing a small increase in the percentage of the popular vote and increased representation in the Canadian House of Commons, with 143 of 308 seats. The 40th Canadian Parliament was dissolved in March 2011, after his government failed a no-confidence vote on the issue of the Cabinet being in contempt of parliament.<\/p>\n<p>In the May 2011 federal election, Harper's Conservative Party won a majority government, the first since the 2000 federal election. His party won 166 seats, an increase of 23 seats from the October 2008 election.<\/p>","image_height":1322,"geohash":"","latest_item_date":"2015-03-18T16:42:41.530199"},{"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=43347","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=43347","id":43347,"created_on":"2013-08-27T17:48:48.047468","recent_count":1,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/f\/f7\/ObituariesontheWall.jpg","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/obituaries\/","daily_count":1,"trend_rank_last":0,"muted_by_default":false,"woeid":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/43347\/","local_url":"\/topic\/obituaries\/","placetype":"","links":"","kind":"vertical","name":"obituaries","category":"Topic","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/LRJ","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Obituary","twitter_username":null,"slug":"obituaries","facebookchat":"","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Obituary\">Wikipedia<\/a>","latitude":null,"active":true,"item_count":1650,"image_width":1000,"trend_rank_current":0,"longitude":null,"livevideo":"","description":"<p>An <b>obituary<\/b> is a news article that reports the recent death of a person, typically along with an account of the person's life and information about the upcoming funeral.

Conceived by George Hamilton when he purchased the Durand farm shortly after the War of 1812, Hamilton has become the centre of a densely populated and industrialized region at the west end of Lake Ontario known as the Golden Horseshoe. On January 1, 2001, the new City of Hamilton was formed through the amalgamation of the former city and the other constituent lower-tier municipalities of the Regional Municipality of Hamilton-Wentworth with the upper-tier regional government. Residents of the old city are known as Hamiltonians. Since 1981, the metropolitan area has been listed as the ninth largest in Canada and the third largest in Ontario.<\/p>\n<p>Hamilton is home to the Royal Botanical Gardens, the Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum, the Bruce Trail, McMaster University and Mohawk College. The Canadian Football Hall of Fame can be found downtown right beside Hamilton City Hall and across town to the east, the Canadian Football League's Hamilton Tiger-Cats will begin playing at the new Tim Hortons Field in 2014, which is being built as part of the 2015 Pan American Games.<\/p>\n<p>Partly because of its diverse environment, numerous TV and film productions have been filmed in Hamilton, regulated by the Hamilton Film and Television Office.

She is also Head of the Commonwealth and Supreme Governor of the Church of England.<\/p>\n<p>Upon her accession on 6 February 1952, Elizabeth became Head of the Commonwealth and queen regnant of seven independent Commonwealth countries: the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Pakistan and Ceylon. Her coronation the following year was the first to be televised. From 1956 to 1992, the number of her realms varied as territories gained independence and some realms became republics. Today, in addition to the first four of the aforementioned countries, Elizabeth is Queen of Jamaica, Barbados, the Bahamas, Grenada, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Belize, Antigua and Barbuda, and Saint Kitts and Nevis. She is the longest-lived and, after her great-great grandmother Queen Victoria, the second longest-reigning British monarch.<\/p>\n<p>Elizabeth was born in London and educated privately at home. Her father acceded to the throne as George VI on the abdication of his brother Edward VIII in 1936, from which time she was the heir presumptive. She began to undertake public duties during the Second World War, in which she served in the Auxiliary Territorial Service. In 1947, she married Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, with whom she has four children: Charles, Anne, Andrew, and Edward.<\/p>\n<p>Elizabeth's many historic visits and meetings include a state visit to the Republic of Ireland, the first state visit of an Irish president to Britain, and reciprocal visits to and from the Pope. She has seen major constitutional changes, such as devolution in the United Kingdom, Canadian patriation and the decolonization of Africa. She has also reigned through various wars and conflicts involving many of her realms.<\/p>\n<p>Times of personal significance have included the births and marriages of her children and grandchildren, the investiture of the Prince of Wales, and the celebration of milestones such as her Silver, Golden, and Diamond Jubilees in 1977, 2002, and 2012, respectively. Moments of sorrow for her include the death of her father at 56, the assassination of Prince Philip's uncle, Lord Mountbatten, the breakdown of her children's marriages in 1992 (a year deemed her <i>annus horribilis<\/i>), the death in 1997 of her son's former wife, Diana, Princess of Wales, and the deaths of her mother and sister in 2002.

Conceived by George Hamilton when he purchased the Durand farm shortly after the War of 1812, Hamilton has become the centre of a densely populated and industrialized region at the west end of Lake Ontario known as the Golden Horseshoe. On January 1, 2001, the new City of Hamilton was formed through the amalgamation of the former city and the other constituent lower-tier municipalities of the Regional Municipality of Hamilton-Wentworth with the upper-tier regional government. Residents of the old city are known as Hamiltonians. Since 1981, the metropolitan area has been listed as the ninth largest in Canada and the third largest in Ontario.<\/p>\n<p>Hamilton is home to the Royal Botanical Gardens, the Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum, the Bruce Trail, McMaster University and Mohawk College. The Canadian Football Hall of Fame can be found downtown right beside Hamilton City Hall and across town to the east, the Canadian Football League's Hamilton Tiger-Cats will begin playing at the new Tim Hortons Field in 2014, which is being built as part of the 2015 Pan American Games.<\/p>\n<p>Partly because of its diverse environment, numerous TV and film productions have been filmed in Hamilton, regulated by the Hamilton Film and Television Office. A growing arts and culture community garnered media attention in 2006 when the <i>Globe and Mail<\/i> published an article called \"Go West, Young Artist\" about Hamilton's growing art scene.

At the Canadian National War Memorial. Michael Zehaf-Bibeau fatally shot Corporal Nathan Cirillo, a Canadian soldier on ceremonial sentry duty. He then entered the nearby Centre Block parliament building at Parliament Hill, where members of the Parliament of Canada were attending caucuses. After wrestling with a security guard at the entrance, Zehaf-Bibeau ran inside and was cornered and killed by the Commons Sergeant at Arms, Kevin Vickers, after a shootout with parliament security personnel. Following the shootings, the downtown core of Ottawa was placed on lockdown while police searched for any potential additional threats. A Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) investigation into the shootings is ongoing.<\/p>\n<p>The attacker, Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, was a 32 year-old Canadian habitual offender and drug addict from Montreal. Considered by several acquaintances to have mental issues, he had been observed by acquaintances and mosque staff exhibiting erratic behaviour. Zehaf-Bibeau, who had a Libyan-Canadian father, had converted to Islam in 2004 and visited Libya. At the time of the shooting, Zehaf-Bibeau planned to leave Canada for the Middle East, living in a homeless shelter in Ottawa while waiting for the processing of his Canadian passport application. According to RCMP Commissioner Bob Paulson the \"passport issue was central to what was driving\" Zehaf-Bibeau. According to the RCMP, Zehaf-Bibeau made a video prior to the attack in which he allegedly expressed his motives as being related \"to Canada's foreign policy and in respect of his religious beliefs.\" To acquaintances and co-workers, he had previously expressed support for jihadists and others in the Middle East resisting the West's intervention, but was not known to the police to be a terrorism risk. In his mother's opinion, the attack was the \"last desperate act\" of someone with a mental disorder who felt trapped.<\/p>\n<p>Classified by the RCMP as a \"terrorist attack\", it was the most serious security breach at Parliament Hill since the 1966 parliament bombing. It took place two days after a man used his car to run over two Canadian soldiers in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec, killing one. The two incidents, which attracted international attention, raised concerns about the effectiveness of police actions to prevent terrorist attacks, the prevention of radicalization and the security measures in-place at federal and provincial legislatures. The Canadian government had already prepared a bill to expand the powers and courtroom anonymity and surveillance powers of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), Canada's spy agency, which was due to be introduced the day of the shootings, and was postponed by the event. The government plans to introduce new anti-terrorism measures. Security at Parliament Hill is to be stepped up.<\/p>","image_height":2544,"geohash":"","latest_item_date":"2014-10-28T16:37:32.533526"},{"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=43347","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=43347","id":43347,"created_on":"2013-08-27T17:48:48.047468","recent_count":1,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/f\/f7\/ObituariesontheWall.jpg","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/obituaries\/","daily_count":1,"trend_rank_last":0,"muted_by_default":false,"woeid":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/43347\/","local_url":"\/topic\/obituaries\/","placetype":"","links":"","kind":"vertical","name":"obituaries","category":"Topic","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/LRJ","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Obituary","twitter_username":null,"slug":"obituaries","facebookchat":"","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Obituary\">Wikipedia<\/a>","latitude":null,"active":true,"item_count":1650,"image_width":1000,"trend_rank_current":0,"longitude":null,"livevideo":"","description":"<p>An <b>obituary<\/b> is a news article that reports the recent death of a person, typically along with an account of the person's life and information about the upcoming funeral.

On January 1, 2001, the new City of Hamilton was formed through the amalgamation of the former city and the other constituent lower-tier municipalities of the Regional Municipality of Hamilton-Wentworth with the upper-tier regional government.

At the Canadian National War Memorial. Michael Zehaf-Bibeau fatally shot Corporal Nathan Cirillo, a Canadian soldier on ceremonial sentry duty. He then entered the nearby Centre Block parliament building at Parliament Hill, where members of the Parliament of Canada were attending caucuses. After wrestling with a security guard at the entrance, Zehaf-Bibeau ran inside and was cornered and killed by the Commons Sergeant at Arms, Kevin Vickers, after a shootout with parliament security personnel. Following the shootings, the downtown core of Ottawa was placed on lockdown while police searched for any potential additional threats. A Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) investigation into the shootings is ongoing.<\/p>\n<p>The attacker, Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, was a 32 year-old Canadian habitual offender and drug addict from Montreal. Considered by several acquaintances to have mental issues, he had been observed by acquaintances and mosque staff exhibiting erratic behaviour. Zehaf-Bibeau, who had a Libyan-Canadian father, had converted to Islam in 2004 and visited Libya. At the time of the shooting, Zehaf-Bibeau planned to leave Canada for the Middle East, living in a homeless shelter in Ottawa while waiting for the processing of his Canadian passport application. According to RCMP Commissioner Bob Paulson the \"passport issue was central to what was driving\" Zehaf-Bibeau. According to the RCMP, Zehaf-Bibeau made a video prior to the attack in which he allegedly expressed his motives as being related \"to Canada's foreign policy and in respect of his religious beliefs.\" To acquaintances and co-workers, he had previously expressed support for jihadists and others in the Middle East resisting the West's intervention, but was not known to the police to be a terrorism risk. In his mother's opinion, the attack was the \"last desperate act\" of someone with a mental disorder who felt trapped.<\/p>\n<p>Classified by the RCMP as a \"terrorist attack\", it was the most serious security breach at Parliament Hill since the 1966 parliament bombing. It took place two days after a man used his car to run over two Canadian soldiers in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec, killing one. The two incidents, which attracted international attention, raised concerns about the effectiveness of police actions to prevent terrorist attacks, the prevention of radicalization and the security measures in-place at federal and provincial legislatures. The Canadian government had already prepared a bill to expand the powers and courtroom anonymity and surveillance powers of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), Canada's spy agency, which was due to be introduced the day of the shootings, and was postponed by the event. The government plans to introduce new anti-terrorism measures. Security at Parliament Hill is to be stepped up.<\/p>","image_height":2544,"geohash":"","latest_item_date":"2014-10-28T16:37:32.533526"},{"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=43347","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=43347","id":43347,"created_on":"2013-08-27T17:48:48.047468","recent_count":1,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/f\/f7\/ObituariesontheWall.jpg","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/obituaries\/","daily_count":1,"trend_rank_last":0,"muted_by_default":false,"woeid":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/43347\/","local_url":"\/topic\/obituaries\/","placetype":"","links":"","kind":"vertical","name":"obituaries","category":"Topic","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/LRJ","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Obituary","twitter_username":null,"slug":"obituaries","facebookchat":"","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Obituary\">Wikipedia<\/a>","latitude":null,"active":true,"item_count":1650,"image_width":1000,"trend_rank_current":0,"longitude":null,"livevideo":"","description":"<p>An <b>obituary<\/b> is a news article that reports the recent death of a person, typically along with an account of the person's life and information about the upcoming funeral.

Remembrance Day is observed on 11 November to recall the end of hostilities of World War I on that date in 1918.

He is the first prime minister to come from the newly reconstituted Conservative Party, which formed after a merger of the Progressive Conservative Party and the Canadian Alliance.<\/p>\n<p>Harper has been the Member of Parliament (MP) for the riding of Calgary Southwest in Alberta since 2002. Earlier, from 1993 to 1997, he was the MP for Calgary West. He was one of the founding members of the Reform Party, but did not seek re-election in the 1997 federal election. Harper instead joined and later led the National Citizens Coalition, a conservative lobbyist group. In 2002, he succeeded Stockwell Day as leader of the Canadian Alliance (the successor to the Reform Party) and returned to parliament as Leader of the Opposition. In 2003, he reached an agreement with Progressive Conservative leader Peter MacKay for the merger of their two parties to form the Conservative Party of Canada. He was elected as the party's first non-interim leader in March 2004.<\/p>\n<p>Harper's Conservative Party won a stronger minority in the October 2008 federal election, showing a small increase in the percentage of the popular vote and increased representation in the Canadian House of Commons, with 143 of 308 seats.

The term crime does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law (i.e. something is a crime if applicable law says that it is). One proposed definition is that a <b>crime<\/b>, also called an <b>offence<\/b> or a <b>criminal offence<\/b>, is an act harmful not only to some individual, but also to the community or the state (a public wrong). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\r\n<p>The idea that acts like murder, rape and theft are prohibited exists all around the world. What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country. While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.<\/p>\r\n<p>The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime. Therefore, in modern societies, a criminal procedure must be adhered to during the investigation and trial. Only if found guilty, the offender may be sentenced to punishment such as community sentence, imprisonment, life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions, even death.<\/p>\r\n<p>To be classified as a crime, the act of doing something bad (actus reus) must be usually accompanied by the intention to do something bad (mens rea), with certain exceptions (strict liability).<\/p>\r\n<p>While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime.

Its common border with the United States is the world's longest land border shared by the same two countries.<\/p>\n<p>The land that is now Canada has been inhabited for millennia by various Aboriginal peoples. Beginning in the late 15th century, British and French colonies were established on the region's Atlantic coast. As a consequence of various conflicts, the United Kingdom gained and lost North American territories until left, in the late 18th century, with what mostly comprises Canada today. Pursuant to the British North America Act, on July 1, 1867 three colonies joined to form the autonomous federal dominion of Canada. This began an accretion of provinces and territories to the new self-governing dominion. In 1931, Britain granted Canada full independence in most matters with the Statute of Westminster 1931. The Canada Act 1982 severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the British parliament.<\/p>\n<p>Canada is a federal parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy, with Queen Elizabeth II as its head of state.

He has served in the United States Senate, and was chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Kerry was the candidate of the Democratic Party in the 2004 presidential election but lost to George W. Bush. Kerry was born in Aurora, Colorado and attended boarding school in Massachusetts and New Hampshire. He graduated from Yale University class of 1966 with a political science major, and was a member of the Skull and Bones secret society. Kerry enlisted in the Naval Reserve in 1966, and during 1968–1969 served an abbreviated four-month tour of duty in South Vietnam as officer-in-charge (OIC) of a Swift Boat. For that service, he was awarded combat medals that include the Silver Star, Bronze Star, and three Purple Hearts. Securing an early return to the United States, Kerry joined the Vietnam Veterans Against the War in which he served as a nationally recognized spokesman and as an outspoken opponent of the Vietnam War. He appeared before the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs where he deemed United States war policy in Vietnam to be the cause of \"war crimes.\"<\/p>\n<p>After receiving his J.D. from Boston College Law School, Kerry worked as an Assistant District Attorney. He served as Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts under Michael Dukakis from 1983 to 1985. He won the Democratic primary in 1984 for the U.S. Senate and was sworn in the following January. On the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he led a series of hearings from 1987 to 1989 which were a precursor to the Iran–Contra affair. Kerry was reelected to additional terms in 1990, 1996, 2002, and 2008. In 2002, Kerry voted to authorize the President \"to use force, if necessary, to disarm Saddam Hussein\", but warned that the administration should exhaust its diplomatic avenues before launching war. In his 2004 presidential campaign, Kerry criticized George W. Bush for the Iraq War. He and his running mate Senator John Edwards lost the race, finishing 35 electoral votes behind Bush-Cheney. Subsequently, he established the Keeping America's Promise PAC. Kerry became chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 2009. Having been nominated by President Barack Obama to succeed outgoing Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and then confirmed by the U.S. Senate by a vote of 94–3 on January 29, 2013, Kerry assumed the office on February 1, 2013.<\/p>","image_height":512,"geohash":"","latest_item_date":"2015-03-23T18:07:19.394182"},{"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=475","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=475","id":475,"created_on":"2010-05-19T15:49:34","recent_count":0,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/1\/1e\/Department_of_state.svg","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/united-states-department-of-state\/","daily_count":2,"trend_rank_last":45,"muted_by_default":false,"woeid":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/475\/","local_url":"\/topic\/united-states-department-of-state\/","placetype":"","links":"","kind":"tag","name":"United States Department of State","category":"Organization","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/Hp","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States_Department_of_State","twitter_username":null,"slug":"united-states-department-of-state","facebookchat":"","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/United_States_Department_of_State\">Wikipedia<\/a>","latitude":null,"active":true,"item_count":1814,"image_width":720,"trend_rank_current":46,"longitude":null,"livevideo":"","description":"<p>The <b>United States Department of State<\/b> (<b>DoS<\/b>), often referred to as the <b>State Department<\/b>, is the United States federal executive department responsible for international relations of the United States, equivalent to the foreign ministry of other countries.

Common definitions of terrorism refer only to those violent acts that are intended to create fear (terror); are perpetrated for a religious, political, or ideological goal; and deliberately target or disregard the safety of non-combatants (e.g., neutral military personnel or civilians). Some definitions now include acts of unlawful violence and war. The use of similar tactics by criminal organizations for protection rackets or to enforce a code of silence is usually not labeled terrorism, though these same actions may be labeled terrorism when done by a politically motivated group. Usage of the term has also been criticized for its frequent undue equating with <i>Islamism<\/i> or <i>jihadism<\/i>, while ignoring non-Islamic organizations or individuals.<\/p>\r\n<p>The word \"terrorism\" is politically loaded and emotionally charged, and this greatly compounds the difficulty of providing a precise definition. Studies have found over 100 definitions of \"terrorism\". In some cases, the same group may be described as \"freedom fighters\" by its supporters and considered to be terrorists by its opponents. The concept of terrorism may be controversial as it is often used by state authorities (and individuals with access to state support) to delegitimize political or other opponents, and potentially legitimize the state's own use of armed force against opponents (such use of force may be described as \"terror\" by opponents of the state). At the same time, the reverse may also take place when states perpetrate or are accused of perpetrating state terrorism. The usage of the term has a controversial history, with individuals such as ANC leader Nelson Mandela at one point also branded a terrorist.<\/p>\r\n<p>Terrorism has been practiced by a broad array of political organizations to further their objectives. It has been practiced by both right-wing and left-wing political parties, nationalistic groups, religious groups, revolutionaries, and ruling governments. An abiding characteristic is the indiscriminate use of violence against non-combatants for the purpose of gaining publicity for a group, cause, or individual. The symbolism of terrorism can exploit human fear to help achieve these goals.<\/p>","image_height":925,"geohash":"","latest_item_date":"2015-03-23T08:46:24.874494"},{"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=1","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=1","id":1,"created_on":"2012-11-28T17:18:53","recent_count":11,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/4\/4b\/Pierre-Paul_Prud%27hon_-_Justice_and_Divine_Vengeance_Pursuing_Crime.JPG","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/crime-courts\/","daily_count":76,"trend_rank_last":1,"muted_by_default":false,"woeid":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/1\/","local_url":"\/topic\/crime-courts\/","placetype":"","links":"","kind":"vertical","name":"crime & courts","category":"Topic","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/B","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Crime","twitter_username":null,"slug":"crime-courts","facebookchat":"","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Crime\">Wikipedia<\/a>","latitude":null,"active":true,"item_count":54161,"image_width":1089,"trend_rank_current":1,"longitude":null,"livevideo":"","description":"<p>In ordinary language, the term <b>crime<\/b> denotes an unlawful act punishable by a state.

The term crime does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law (i.e. something is a crime if applicable law says that it is). One proposed definition is that a <b>crime<\/b>, also called an <b>offence<\/b> or a <b>criminal offence<\/b>, is an act harmful not only to some individual, but also to the community or the state (a public wrong). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\r\n<p>The idea that acts like murder, rape and theft are prohibited exists all around the world. What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country. While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.<\/p>\r\n<p>The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime. Therefore, in modern societies, a criminal procedure must be adhered to during the investigation and trial. Only if found guilty, the offender may be sentenced to punishment such as community sentence, imprisonment, life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions, even death.<\/p>\r\n<p>To be classified as a crime, the act of doing something bad (actus reus) must be usually accompanied by the intention to do something bad (mens rea), with certain exceptions (strict liability).<\/p>\r\n<p>While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime.

Its common border with the United States is the world's longest land border shared by the same two countries.<\/p>\n<p>The land that is now Canada has been inhabited for millennia by various Aboriginal peoples. Beginning in the late 15th century, British and French colonies were established on the region's Atlantic coast. As a consequence of various conflicts, the United Kingdom gained and lost North American territories until left, in the late 18th century, with what mostly comprises Canada today. Pursuant to the British North America Act, on July 1, 1867 three colonies joined to form the autonomous federal dominion of Canada. This began an accretion of provinces and territories to the new self-governing dominion. In 1931, Britain granted Canada full independence in most matters with the Statute of Westminster 1931. The Canada Act 1982 severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the British parliament.<\/p>\n<p>Canada is a federal parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy, with Queen Elizabeth II as its head of state. Canada is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations. The country is officially bilingual at the federal level. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many countries, with a population of approximately 35 million as of December 2012. Its advanced economy is one of the largest in the world, relying chiefly upon its abundant natural resources and well-developed trade networks. Canada's long and complex relationship with the United States has had a significant impact on its economy and culture.<\/p>\n<p>Canada is a developed country and one of the wealthiest in the world, with the eighth highest per capita income globally, and the eighth highest ranking in the Human Development Index.

Canada also ranks among the world's most educated countries, and was ranked first worldwide in the number of adults having tertiary education with 51% of adults having attained at least an undergraduate college or university degree according to OECD's 2012 survey. Canada's participation in economic international and intergovernmental institutions or groupings includes the G8 (Group of Eight); the Group of Ten (economic); the Group of Twenty (G-20 major economies); the North American Free Trade Agreement; and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.

The history of Toronto began in the late 18th century when the British Crown purchased its land from the Mississaugas of the New Credit. The settlement established there became York, which lieutenant governor John Graves Simcoe designated as the capital of Upper Canada. The city was ransacked in the Battle of York during the War of 1812. In 1834, York became a city and renamed to Toronto. It was damaged in two huge fires in 1849 and 1904.

However, in 2012, the municipal government published a population estimate of 2,791,140, which led to media reports claiming Toronto as the fourth most populous city in North America and the most populous Great Lakes city, surpassing Chicago. The census metropolitan area (CMA) had a population of 5,583,064, and the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) had a population of 6,054,191 in the 2011 Census. Toronto is at the heart of the Greater Toronto Area, and of the densely populated region in Southern Ontario known as the Golden Horseshoe.

The Stanley Cup, the oldest professional sports trophy in North America, is awarded annually to the league playoff champion at the end of each season.<\/p>\n<p>The National Hockey League was organized on November 26, 1917, in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, after the suspension of operations of its predecessor organization, the National Hockey Association (NHA), which had been founded in 1909.

The \"nation\" referred to by the league's name was Canada, although the league has now been binational since 1924 when its first team in the United States, the Boston Bruins, began play. After a labour dispute that led to the cancellation of the entire 2004–05 season, the league resumed play under a new collective agreement that included a salary cap. In 2009, the NHL enjoyed record highs in terms of sponsorships, attendance, and television audiences.<\/p>\n<p>The league draws many highly skilled players from all over the world and currently has players from about 20 different countries. Although Canadians have historically constituted the majority of the players in the league, over the past four plus decades the percentages of American and European players have increased both because of the league's continued expansion from six to thirty clubs since 1967, and the increased availability of highly skilled European players.<\/p>","image_height":82,"geohash":"","latest_item_date":"2015-03-18T15:32:22.773248"},{"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=55","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=55","id":55,"created_on":"2012-10-23T22:09:20","recent_count":1,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/9\/92\/Youth-soccer-indiana.jpg","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/sports\/","daily_count":16,"trend_rank_last":62,"muted_by_default":false,"woeid":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/55\/","local_url":"\/topic\/sports\/","placetype":"","links":"","kind":"vertical","name":"sports","category":"Topic","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/3","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sport","twitter_username":null,"slug":"sports","facebookchat":"","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sport\">Wikipedia<\/a>","latitude":null,"active":true,"item_count":14299,"image_width":2500,"trend_rank_current":61,"longitude":null,"livevideo":"","description":"<p><b>Sport<\/b> (or <b>sports<\/b>) is all forms of usually competitive physical activity which, through casual or organised participation, aim to use, maintain or improve physical ability and skills while providing entertainment to participants, and in some cases, spectators. Hundreds of sports exist, from those requiring only two participants, through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants, either in teams or competing as individuals.<\/p>\n<p>Sport is generally recognised as activities which are based in physical athleticism or physical dexterity, with the largest major competitions such as the Olympic Games admitting only sports meeting this definition, and other organisations such as the Council of Europe using definitions precluding activities without a physical element from classification as sports. However, a number of competitive, but non-physical, activities claim recognition as mind sports. The International Olympic Committee (through ARISF) recognises both chess and bridge as <i>bona fide<\/i> sports, and SportAccord, the international sports federation association, recognises five non-physical sports, although limits the amount of mind games which can be admitted as sports.<\/p>\n<p>Sports are usually governed by a set of rules or customs, which serve to ensure fair competition, and allow consistent adjudication of the winner. Winning can be determined by physical events such as scoring goals or crossing a line first, or by the determination of judges who are scoring elements of the sporting performance, including objective or subjective measures such as technical performance or artistic impression.<\/p>\n<p>In organised sport, records of performance are often kept, and for popular sports, this information may be widely announced or reported in sport news. In addition, sport is a major source of entertainment for non-participants, with spectator sport drawing large crowds to venues, and reaching wider audiences through broadcasting.<\/p>\n<p>According to A.T.

At the Canadian National War Memorial. Michael Zehaf-Bibeau fatally shot Corporal Nathan Cirillo, a Canadian soldier on ceremonial sentry duty. He then entered the nearby Centre Block parliament building at Parliament Hill, where members of the Parliament of Canada were attending caucuses. After wrestling with a security guard at the entrance, Zehaf-Bibeau ran inside and was cornered and killed by the Commons Sergeant at Arms, Kevin Vickers, after a shootout with parliament security personnel. Following the shootings, the downtown core of Ottawa was placed on lockdown while police searched for any potential additional threats. A Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) investigation into the shootings is ongoing.<\/p>\n<p>The attacker, Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, was a 32 year-old Canadian habitual offender and drug addict from Montreal. Considered by several acquaintances to have mental issues, he had been observed by acquaintances and mosque staff exhibiting erratic behaviour. Zehaf-Bibeau, who had a Libyan-Canadian father, had converted to Islam in 2004 and visited Libya. At the time of the shooting, Zehaf-Bibeau planned to leave Canada for the Middle East, living in a homeless shelter in Ottawa while waiting for the processing of his Canadian passport application. According to RCMP Commissioner Bob Paulson the \"passport issue was central to what was driving\" Zehaf-Bibeau. According to the RCMP, Zehaf-Bibeau made a video prior to the attack in which he allegedly expressed his motives as being related \"to Canada's foreign policy and in respect of his religious beliefs.\" To acquaintances and co-workers, he had previously expressed support for jihadists and others in the Middle East resisting the West's intervention, but was not known to the police to be a terrorism risk. In his mother's opinion, the attack was the \"last desperate act\" of someone with a mental disorder who felt trapped.<\/p>\n<p>Classified by the RCMP as a \"terrorist attack\", it was the most serious security breach at Parliament Hill since the 1966 parliament bombing. It took place two days after a man used his car to run over two Canadian soldiers in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec, killing one. The two incidents, which attracted international attention, raised concerns about the effectiveness of police actions to prevent terrorist attacks, the prevention of radicalization and the security measures in-place at federal and provincial legislatures. The Canadian government had already prepared a bill to expand the powers and courtroom anonymity and surveillance powers of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), Canada's spy agency, which was due to be introduced the day of the shootings, and was postponed by the event. The government plans to introduce new anti-terrorism measures. Security at Parliament Hill is to be stepped up.<\/p>","image_height":2544,"geohash":"","latest_item_date":"2014-10-28T16:37:32.533526"},{"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=1","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=1","id":1,"created_on":"2012-11-28T17:18:53","recent_count":11,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/4\/4b\/Pierre-Paul_Prud%27hon_-_Justice_and_Divine_Vengeance_Pursuing_Crime.JPG","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/crime-courts\/","daily_count":76,"trend_rank_last":1,"muted_by_default":false,"woeid":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/1\/","local_url":"\/topic\/crime-courts\/","placetype":"","links":"","kind":"vertical","name":"crime & courts","category":"Topic","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/B","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Crime","twitter_username":null,"slug":"crime-courts","facebookchat":"","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Crime\">Wikipedia<\/a>","latitude":null,"active":true,"item_count":54161,"image_width":1089,"trend_rank_current":1,"longitude":null,"livevideo":"","description":"<p>In ordinary language, the term <b>crime<\/b> denotes an unlawful act punishable by a state. The term crime does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law (i.e. something is a crime if applicable law says that it is). One proposed definition is that a <b>crime<\/b>, also called an <b>offence<\/b> or a <b>criminal offence<\/b>, is an act harmful not only to some individual, but also to the community or the state (a public wrong). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\r\n<p>The idea that acts like murder, rape and theft are prohibited exists all around the world. What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country. While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.<\/p>\r\n<p>The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime. Therefore, in modern societies, a criminal procedure must be adhered to during the investigation and trial. Only if found guilty, the offender may be sentenced to punishment such as community sentence, imprisonment, life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions, even death.<\/p>\r\n<p>To be classified as a crime, the act of doing something bad (actus reus) must be usually accompanied by the intention to do something bad (mens rea), with certain exceptions (strict liability).<\/p>\r\n<p>While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime.

Located in the northern part of the continent, it extends from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean. At 9.98 million square kilometres in total, Canada is the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Its common border with the United States is the world's longest land border shared by the same two countries.<\/p>\n<p>The land that is now Canada has been inhabited for millennia by various Aboriginal peoples. Beginning in the late 15th century, British and French colonies were established on the region's Atlantic coast. As a consequence of various conflicts, the United Kingdom gained and lost North American territories until left, in the late 18th century, with what mostly comprises Canada today. Pursuant to the British North America Act, on July 1, 1867 three colonies joined to form the autonomous federal dominion of Canada. This began an accretion of provinces and territories to the new self-governing dominion. In 1931, Britain granted Canada full independence in most matters with the Statute of Westminster 1931. The Canada Act 1982 severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the British parliament.<\/p>\n<p>Canada is a federal parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy, with Queen Elizabeth II as its head of state. Canada is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations. The country is officially bilingual at the federal level. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many countries, with a population of approximately 35 million as of December 2012. Its advanced economy is one of the largest in the world, relying chiefly upon its abundant natural resources and well-developed trade networks. Canada's long and complex relationship with the United States has had a significant impact on its economy and culture.<\/p>\n<p>Canada is a developed country and one of the wealthiest in the world, with the eighth highest per capita income globally, and the eighth highest ranking in the Human Development Index. It ranks among the highest in international measurements of education, government transparency, civil liberties, quality of life, and economic freedom. Canada also ranks among the world's most educated countries, and was ranked first worldwide in the number of adults having tertiary education with 51% of adults having attained at least an undergraduate college or university degree according to OECD's 2012 survey. Canada's participation in economic international and intergovernmental institutions or groupings includes the G8 (Group of Eight); the Group of Ten (economic); the Group of Twenty (G-20 major economies); the North American Free Trade Agreement; and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.

The 2011 census recorded 603,502 people in the city, making it the eighth largest Canadian municipality. Vancouver is one of the most ethnically and linguistically diverse cities in Canada; 52% of its residents have a first language other than English. The Greater Vancouver area of around 2.4 million inhabitants is the third most populous metropolitan area in the country and the most populous in Western Canada. Vancouver is a Beta global city.<\/p>\n<p>The City of Vancouver encompasses a land area of about 114 square kilometres, giving it a population density of about 5,249 people per square kilometre (13,590 per square mile). Vancouver is the most densely populated Canadian municipality, and the fourth most densely populated city over 250,000 residents in North America, behind New York City, San Francisco, and Mexico City.<\/p>\n<p>The original settlement, named Gastown, grew around the Hastings Mill logging sawmill and a nearby tavern, both established in 1867. Enlarging to become the townsite of Granville, with the announcement that the railhead would reach the site it was renamed \"Vancouver\" and incorporated as a city in 1886. By 1887, the transcontinental railway was extended to the city to take advantage of its large natural seaport, which soon became a vital link in a trade route between the Orient, Eastern Canada, and London. As of 2009, Port Metro Vancouver is the busiest and largest port in Canada, and the most diversified port in North America. While forestry remains its largest industry, Vancouver is well known as an urban centre surrounded by nature, making tourism its second-largest industry. Major film production studios in Vancouver and Burnaby have turned Metro Vancouver into one of the largest film production centres in North America, earning it the film industry nickname, Hollywood North.<\/p>\n<p>Vancouver is consistently named as one of the top five worldwide cities for livability and quality of life, and the Economist Intelligence Unit acknowledged it as the first city to rank among the top-ten of the world's most liveable cities for five consecutive years. Vancouver has hosted many international conferences and events, including the 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games, UN Habitat I, Expo 86, and the World Police and Fire Games in 1989 and 2009. In 2014, following thirty years in California, Vancouver became the indefinite home of the annual TED conference. Canada will host the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup, and several matches will be played in Vancouver, including the final at BC Place Stadium. The 2010 Winter Olympics and 2010 Winter Paralympics were held in Vancouver and nearby Whistler, a resort community 125 km (78 mi) north of the city.<\/p>","image_height":1606,"geohash":"c2b2nrx4euh5","latest_item_date":"2015-03-13T19:15:30.295371"},{"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=87688","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=87688","id":87688,"created_on":"2014-10-22T20:20:29.461374","recent_count":0,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/b\/b2\/Centre_Block_-_Parliament_Hill.jpg","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/michael-zehaf-bibeau\/","daily_count":0,"trend_rank_last":0,"muted_by_default":false,"woeid":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/87688\/","local_url":"\/topic\/michael-zehaf-bibeau\/","placetype":"","links":"","kind":"tag","name":"Michael Zehaf-Bibeau","category":"Person","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/WyU","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2014_shootings_at_Parliament_Hill,_Ottawa","twitter_username":null,"slug":"michael-zehaf-bibeau","facebookchat":"","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2014_shootings_at_Parliament_Hill,_Ottawa\">Wikipedia<\/a>","latitude":null,"active":true,"item_count":22,"image_width":3384,"trend_rank_current":0,"longitude":null,"livevideo":"","description":"<p>On October 22, 2014, several shooting incidents occurred around Parliament Hill in Ottawa.

The term crime does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law (i.e. something is a crime if applicable law says that it is). One proposed definition is that a <b>crime<\/b>, also called an <b>offence<\/b> or a <b>criminal offence<\/b>, is an act harmful not only to some individual, but also to the community or the state (a public wrong). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\r\n<p>The idea that acts like murder, rape and theft are prohibited exists all around the world. What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country. While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.<\/p>\r\n<p>The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime. Therefore, in modern societies, a criminal procedure must be adhered to during the investigation and trial. Only if found guilty, the offender may be sentenced to punishment such as community sentence, imprisonment, life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions, even death.<\/p>\r\n<p>To be classified as a crime, the act of doing something bad (actus reus) must be usually accompanied by the intention to do something bad (mens rea), with certain exceptions (strict liability).<\/p>\r\n<p>While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime.

Its common border with the United States is the world's longest land border shared by the same two countries.<\/p>\n<p>The land that is now Canada has been inhabited for millennia by various Aboriginal peoples. Beginning in the late 15th century, British and French colonies were established on the region's Atlantic coast. As a consequence of various conflicts, the United Kingdom gained and lost North American territories until left, in the late 18th century, with what mostly comprises Canada today. Pursuant to the British North America Act, on July 1, 1867 three colonies joined to form the autonomous federal dominion of Canada. This began an accretion of provinces and territories to the new self-governing dominion. In 1931, Britain granted Canada full independence in most matters with the Statute of Westminster 1931. The Canada Act 1982 severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the British parliament.<\/p>\n<p>Canada is a federal parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy, with Queen Elizabeth II as its head of state. Canada is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations. The country is officially bilingual at the federal level. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many countries, with a population of approximately 35 million as of December 2012. Its advanced economy is one of the largest in the world, relying chiefly upon its abundant natural resources and well-developed trade networks.

At the Canadian National War Memorial. Michael Zehaf-Bibeau fatally shot Corporal Nathan Cirillo, a Canadian soldier on ceremonial sentry duty. He then entered the nearby Centre Block parliament building at Parliament Hill, where members of the Parliament of Canada were attending caucuses. After wrestling with a security guard at the entrance, Zehaf-Bibeau ran inside and was cornered and killed by the Commons Sergeant at Arms, Kevin Vickers, after a shootout with parliament security personnel. Following the shootings, the downtown core of Ottawa was placed on lockdown while police searched for any potential additional threats. A Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) investigation into the shootings is ongoing.<\/p>\n<p>The attacker, Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, was a 32 year-old Canadian habitual offender and drug addict from Montreal. Considered by several acquaintances to have mental issues, he had been observed by acquaintances and mosque staff exhibiting erratic behaviour. Zehaf-Bibeau, who had a Libyan-Canadian father, had converted to Islam in 2004 and visited Libya. At the time of the shooting, Zehaf-Bibeau planned to leave Canada for the Middle East, living in a homeless shelter in Ottawa while waiting for the processing of his Canadian passport application. According to RCMP Commissioner Bob Paulson the \"passport issue was central to what was driving\" Zehaf-Bibeau. According to the RCMP, Zehaf-Bibeau made a video prior to the attack in which he allegedly expressed his motives as being related \"to Canada's foreign policy and in respect of his religious beliefs.\" To acquaintances and co-workers, he had previously expressed support for jihadists and others in the Middle East resisting the West's intervention, but was not known to the police to be a terrorism risk. In his mother's opinion, the attack was the \"last desperate act\" of someone with a mental disorder who felt trapped.<\/p>\n<p>Classified by the RCMP as a \"terrorist attack\", it was the most serious security breach at Parliament Hill since the 1966 parliament bombing. It took place two days after a man used his car to run over two Canadian soldiers in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec, killing one. The two incidents, which attracted international attention, raised concerns about the effectiveness of police actions to prevent terrorist attacks, the prevention of radicalization and the security measures in-place at federal and provincial legislatures. The Canadian government had already prepared a bill to expand the powers and courtroom anonymity and surveillance powers of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), Canada's spy agency, which was due to be introduced the day of the shootings, and was postponed by the event. The government plans to introduce new anti-terrorism measures. Security at Parliament Hill is to be stepped up.<\/p>","image_height":2544,"geohash":"","latest_item_date":"2014-10-28T16:37:32.533526"},{"items_resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?topics=1","related_topics_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/?related_to=1","id":1,"created_on":"2012-11-28T17:18:53","recent_count":11,"image_url":"http:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/4\/4b\/Pierre-Paul_Prud%27hon_-_Justice_and_Divine_Vengeance_Pursuing_Crime.JPG","permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/topic\/crime-courts\/","daily_count":76,"trend_rank_last":1,"muted_by_default":false,"woeid":null,"resource_uri":"\/api\/v1\/topic\/1\/","local_url":"\/topic\/crime-courts\/","placetype":"","links":"","kind":"vertical","name":"crime & courts","category":"Topic","short_permalink":"http:\/\/www.breakingnews.com\/t\/B","wikipedia_url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Crime","twitter_username":null,"slug":"crime-courts","facebookchat":"","image_credit":"Photo: <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Crime\">Wikipedia<\/a>","latitude":null,"active":true,"item_count":54161,"image_width":1089,"trend_rank_current":1,"longitude":null,"livevideo":"","description":"<p>In ordinary language, the term <b>crime<\/b> denotes an unlawful act punishable by a state. The term crime does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law (i.e. something is a crime if applicable law says that it is). One proposed definition is that a <b>crime<\/b>, also called an <b>offence<\/b> or a <b>criminal offence<\/b>, is an act harmful not only to some individual, but also to the community or the state (a public wrong). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.<\/p>\r\n<p>The idea that acts like murder, rape and theft are prohibited exists all around the world. What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country. While many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.<\/p>\r\n<p>The state (government) has the power to severely restrict one's liberty for committing a crime. Therefore, in modern societies, a criminal procedure must be adhered to during the investigation and trial. Only if found guilty, the offender may be sentenced to punishment such as community sentence, imprisonment, life imprisonment or, in some jurisdictions, even death.<\/p>\r\n<p>To be classified as a crime, the act of doing something bad (actus reus) must be usually accompanied by the intention to do something bad (mens rea), with certain exceptions (strict liability).<\/p>\r\n<p>While every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime. Breaches of private law (torts and breaches of contract) are not automatically punished by the state, but can be enforced through civil procedure.<\/p>","image_height":900,"geohash":"","latest_item_date":"2015-03-24T01:14:53.150744"}]}],"meta":{"limit":20,"next":"\/api\/v1\/item\/?type__in=text%2Ctweet%2Cnote%2Cdata&date__lt=2014-10-24+19%3A38%3A04.663440%2B00%3A00&status__in=published%2Cwhitelisted&topics=87613"}}
